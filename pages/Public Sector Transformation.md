<h3><strong>Transforming for a better tomorrow</strong></h3>
<p>The speed of change around the world is accelerating. We face an ageing
population and shrinking workforce, fiscal constraints, rising citizen
expectations, and technological disruption.</p>
<p>To ensure we continue to serve Singapore well, the Public Service has
stepped up efforts to transform and plan for tomorrow’s challenges, even
as we adapt to meet the needs and problems of today.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transforming how we work as One
Public Service</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transforming and empowering our
workforce</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transforming our officers’ workplace
experience</p>
<h4><strong>Transforming</strong> <strong>how we work as One Public Service</strong></h4>
<p>We have embraced innovative technology, streamlined our services and pursued
partnerships to deliver better services as One Public Service.</p>
<p><strong>Citizen-centric service delivery</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ServiceSG: Driving a citizen-centric approach to public service delivery</strong>
</p>
<p>Under the Public Sector Transformation movement, ServiceSG has been working
across the whole of Government to transform the way public services are
delivered to citizens.</p>
<p>It has been driving a citizen-centric approach by integrating public services
across agencies, organising them around key life moments, and delivering
them to citizens through an omni-channel network of physical service centres,
a central call centre and a digital platform, LifeSG.</p>
<p>Each ServiceSG touchpoint provides citizens with access to multiple services
from different public sector agencies, improving citizens' experience of
Government services. For example, at ServiceSG centres, citizens can receive
assistance on close to 600 Government services and schemes from over 25
agencies.</p>

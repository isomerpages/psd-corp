<h3><strong>Transforming for a better tomorrow</strong></h3>
<p>The speed of change around the world is accelerating. We face an ageing
population and shrinking workforce, fiscal constraints, rising citizen
expectations, and technological disruption.</p>
<p>To ensure we continue to serve Singapore well, the Public Service has
stepped up efforts to transform and plan for tomorrow’s challenges, even
as we adapt to meet the needs and problems of today.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transforming how we work as One
Public Service</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transforming and empowering our
workforce</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transforming our officers’ workplace
experience</p>
<h4><strong>Transforming</strong> <strong>how we work as One Public Service</strong></h4>
<p>We have embraced innovative technology, streamlined our services and pursued
partnerships to deliver better services as One Public Service.</p>

<p><strong>ServiceSG: Driving a citizen-centric approach to public service delivery</strong>

<p>Under the Public Sector Transformation movement, ServiceSG has been working
across the whole of Government to transform the way public services are
delivered to citizens.</p>
<p>It has been driving a citizen-centric approach by integrating public services
across agencies, organising them around key life moments, and delivering
them to citizens through an omni-channel network of physical service centres,
a central call centre and a digital platform, LifeSG.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each ServiceSG touchpoint provides citizens with access to multiple services
from different public sector agencies, improving citizens' experience of
Government services. For example, at ServiceSG centres, citizens can receive
assistance on close to 600 Government services and schemes from over 25
agencies.</p>

<p><strong>ICA: Transforming border clearance and security</strong>
</p>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) transformed
its checkpoint clearance operations.</p>
<p>It introduced passport-less immigration clearance at the land, sea, and
air checkpoints for Singapore residents. It also extended full automated
clearance to all travellers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These technological leaps resulted in faster immigration clearance for
travellers, and enhanced security measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ICA’s initiative exemplified the public sector's commitment to innovation
and efficiency in service delivery.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the NCC, ICA demonstrated how innovative technology can transform
public services, significantly improving operational efficiency while strengthening
border security. By automating once manual tasks, ICA officers are now
upskilled to handle more complex aspects of immigration clearance and border
security, ensuring a safer and more seamless experience for travellers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This successful implementation of the NCC serves as a model for public
sector transformation, showcasing how embracing technology can lead to
better outcomes for both citizens and public servants.</p>

<h4><strong>Transforming and empowering our workforce</strong></h4>
<p>Transformation is not just about processes and policies—it is also about
equipping our people to be future-ready.</p>
<p>We will continue to expose our officers to varied experiences within and
outside the public sector to deepen their competencies and expand their
perspectives and networks. We are also strengthening our ability to compose
teams with diverse abilities to resolve and pre-empt problems as our challenges
become more complex and interlinked.</p>

<summary><strong>Empowering competency-driven growth</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>We have moved towards a Competency-Driven Growth framework, where we translate
changing business needs into job competencies, and outline the competencies
officers need to develop to perform their functions well. This provides
a common language for public officers and Public Service leaders to discuss
the competencies that need to be built and exercised within each role.</p>

<p>To further our cause for Singapore to thrive, and for Singaporeans to
have opportunities to fulfil their potential and dreams, the Public Service
is sending more public officers beyond the Public Service and Singapore

<h4><strong>Transforming our officers’ workplace experience</strong></h4>
<p>A productive and supportive work environment is key to our success. We

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>We enable offices to balance their work-life priorities with flexible
work arrangements. These include flexi-load (e.g. part-time), flexi-place
(e.g. telecommuting) and flexi-time (e.g. staggered hours), subject to
the operational requirements of the role and public agency.</p>

<p>CoWork@Gov has enhanced the way public officers work by providing a network
of shared spaces across Singapore. These spaces offer officers flexibility
in their workday, whether they need a quiet spot to work between meetings,
a convenient location to catch up on tasks, or a collaborative environment
for cross-agency discussions. By making workspaces available at various
locations, CoWork@Gov supports a more mobile and connected public service,
helping officers make better use of their time while fostering opportunities
for collaboration across agencies.</p>

<p>Public Service for Good (PSFG) empowers public officers to make a meaningful
difference in society through skills-based volunteering. This purposeful
initiative enables officers to contribute their expertise across four key
areas: empowering those in need, supporting seniors to age well, investing
in sustainability, and building our home together with Singaporeans. Beyond
just volunteering, PSFG offers officers valuable opportunities to strengthen
their connection with citizens, deepen their understanding of ground realities,
and develop new capabilities while serving the community.</p>

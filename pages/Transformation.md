The speed of change around the world is accelerating. The Public Service faces an ageing population and shrinking workforce, fiscal constraints, rising citizen expectations, and technological disruption.  
  
Hence, the Public Service has stepped up transformation efforts to build a future Singapore that continues to be successful and vibrant. We want to think and act boldly to tackle challenges and exploit new opportunities. We also know that citizens want to have a part in finding solutions, and digital solutions can help improve productivity.

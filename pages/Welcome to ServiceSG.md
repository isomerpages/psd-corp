<h2><strong>ABOUT SERVICESG</strong></h2>

</div>
<p>ServiceSG is a department within the PSD in the Prime Minister’s Office
(PMO). Established as part of the Public Sector Transformation (PST) movement,
ServiceSG works across the whole of government to transform public service
delivery to serve citizens better.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>It drives a citizen-centric approach to service delivery by integrating
public services across agencies, organising them around key life moments,
and delivering them through an omni-channel network of physical centres,
a central call centre and a digital platform, LifeSG.
<br>
</p>
<p>It also strengthens service delivery capabilities within the Public Service,
and continually works to raise overall service standards across the whole
of government to improve citizens’ experience of government services.</p>

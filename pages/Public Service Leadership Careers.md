The Singapore Public Service offers an attractive career proposition for those who want to make a difference in service of Singapore and Singaporeans. To navigate a more complex and fast-changing environment, the Public Service needs a diversity of strengths and perspectives in our leadership ranks.&nbsp; We therefore welcome leaders with different backgrounds, who wish to contribute their skills and perspectives in the Public Service to make a meaningful impact to Singapore and Singaporeans.  
  
There are two central leadership development (LD) programmes in the Singapore Public Service – the Administrative Service (AS) and the Public Service Leadership Programme (PSLP) – to systematically groom leadership talent for senior leadership job roles across the Public Service. There are options for officers to pursue multi-sectoral or sectoral LD tracks, depending on their preferences and fit.  
  
By joining us on a Public Service Leadership Careers, we will invest in your development and support you in growing the competencies, perspectives, and instincts that are critical for both current and future operating contexts.  
  
A key feature is the opportunity to undergo structured job postings across public agencies - this means that your development will not be limited to a single agency, and you will be exposed to the critical job experiences and key issues across the key sectors of Government.  
  
The Public Service thus offers a range of career pathways and job options curated to support your development and in ways that would fit your career aspirations as an aspiring leader.

Here are some areas you could contribute to, across the key sectors of Government:

**Administrative Service**
==========================

The Administrative Service aims to develop leaders with whole-of-government perspectives and capabilities, to formulate and implement policies that will improve the lives of Singaporeans.

You will gain a deep understanding of the interdependencies across the Public Service through your career in the Administrative Service. You will enjoy the unique opportunity to work in different sectors of the Public Service and be developed for key leadership positions through structured programmes.

**The Career Path**

The Public Service Division aims to develop Administrative Officers with the interest and aptitude in integrating work across sectors, to have a sound grasp of the complexities of government. Taking into account your interests and Public Service needs, you may be posted to jobs in different sectors of the Public Service, namely &nbsp;Infrastructure &amp; Environment, Economy Building, Social, Security,&nbsp; Information and Communications Technology &amp; Smart Systems, and Central Administration.

This multi-sectoral developmental track aims to develop leaders who:

*   Master the substance of the issues they are dealing with, when designing and implementing policies within and across sectors with domain depth in 2-3 sectors
*   Provide WOG / strategic perspectives, with the ability to “connect the dots”, and synergise and integrate work across different sectors, by leveraging cross-agency networks and experience
*   Provide the key interface between the political leadership and the public service in developing and implementing policies and programmes

As you progress in your career, you will participate in milestone training programmes, and be given expert coaching to facilitate your professional development. You will get to be part of project teams where you can recommend policies and have the opportunity to present your findings to senior public service leaders or at various policy forums.

**Other Deployment Opportunities**

As an&nbsp;Administrative Officer, you could be posted to private sector companies to better understand businesses and markets, or to the various statutory boards and government-linked Companies.

**Mid-Career Leaders Track (MCLT)**

The Public Service values the experiences of mid-career entrants outside of the Public Service and is interested to groom talents with the heart to serve. The Public Service will be introducing the “Mid-Career Leaders Track” - a central gateway for mid-career entrants with the potential and aspiration to serve in Public Service leadership.

**Key Features of MCLT:**

Central gateway for mid-career entrants to apply for Leadership Programmes in the Public Service**

- Candidates can apply without needing to choose to join the AS/PSLP or any specific government agencies. Successful candidates will be placed onto the appropriate leadership programme, where their past work experiences will be taken into account when curating relevant postings / developmental opportunities, based on the assessed calibre, readiness and seniority.

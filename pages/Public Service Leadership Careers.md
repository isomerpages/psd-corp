The Singapore Public Service offers an attractive career proposition for those who want to make a difference in service of Singapore and Singaporeans. To navigate a more complex and fast-changing environment, the Public Service needs a diversity of strengths and perspectives in our leadership ranks.&nbsp; We therefore welcome leaders with different backgrounds, who wish to contribute their skills and perspectives in the Public Service to make a meaningful impact to Singapore and Singaporeans.  
  
There are two central leadership development (LD) programmes in the Singapore Public Service – the Administrative Service (AS) and the Public Service Leadership Programme (PSLP) – to systematically groom leadership talent for senior leadership job roles across the Public Service. There are options for officers to pursue multi-sectoral or sectoral LD tracks, depending on their preferences and fit.  
  
By joining us on a Public Service Leadership Careers, we will invest in your development and support you in growing the competencies, perspectives, and instincts that are critical for both current and future operating contexts.  
  
A key feature is the opportunity to undergo structured job postings across public agencies - this means that your development will not be limited to a single agency, and you will be exposed to the critical job experiences and key issues across the key sectors of Government.  
  
The Public Service thus offers a range of career pathways and job options curated to support your development and in ways that would fit your career aspirations as an aspiring leader.

Here are some areas you could contribute to, across the key sectors of Government:

description: Strengthening leadership abilities, behaviours and values at all
  levels in the Public Service

In the Public Service,&nbsp;leadership is not about positions or titles. Public Service leaders are driven by a passion to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, and are dedicated to serve the people they lead. They lead by example and demonstrate the values of Integrity, Service and Excellence through their actions. As the global environment is increasingly complex, we need leaders who can provide Whole-of-Government perspectives and resolve systems-level tensions, as well as leaders with deep expertise in a range of areas to address more complex policy, operational and service delivery challenges.

# Strengthening leadership abilities, behaviours and values at all levels

In the Public Service,&nbsp;leadership is not about positions or titles. Public Service leaders are driven by a passion to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, and are dedicated to serve the people they lead. They lead by example and demonstrate the values of Integrity, Service and Excellence through their actions. As the global environment is increasingly complex, we need leaders who can provide Whole-of-Government perspectives and resolve systems-level tensions, as well as leaders with deep expertise in a range of areas to address more complex policy, operational and service delivery challenges.

**Attracting and recruiting leaders**

We identify, develop and manage the pipeline of multi-sectoral and sectoral/specialist public sector leaders.

**Developing leaders**

We oversee the development of officers in the Administrative Service and Public Service Leadership Programme. To develop the Public Service leadership, we formulate, implement and review policies to ensure leaders have the competencies, perspectives and instincts to anticipate and address current and future needs and challenges.

**Engaging and inspiring leaders**

We provide platforms that enable the leadership to connect, align and share perspectives. Among government agencies, we promote the exchange of best practices in talent development.

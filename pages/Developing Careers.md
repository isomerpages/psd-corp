#### Partnering public officers to build our Future Workforce

As the central HR agency, we lead the way in HR practices. We keep up-to-date with emerging trends and work practices to ensure our HR practices remain relevant and are able to meet the current and future needs of the organisation and our officers.

## 3 Ways we develop careers

#### We offer many opportunities within the Public Service

As work becomes more complex and dynamic, where jobs and skills are constantly evolving, it is getting more difficult to assess most officers' potential accurately, particularly early in their careers.  
  
Officers today will also have longer careers with different episodes of work. We encourage the growth and development for all officers. It is therefore more meaningful to develop officersâ€™ skills and competencies for their next career milestone, over shorter time horizons.

#### We believe in supporting your career aspirations

To support public officer's career aspirations, we introduce new programmes designed to broaden their experience and gain new perspectives and insights outside their current role. Covering different functional areas, sectors and time commitment, these opportunities will also help you grow your networks and deepen you skills.  
  
The Short Term Immersion Programme allows officers to gain on-the-job experience through shadowing and hands-on participation in another agency for a duration of 1 day to 4 weeks. Another short-term initiative is the Gig Work programme, which enables officers to contribute their expertise and experience to cross-agency Public Service projects.

Long-term stints include Structured Job Rotation within the Public Service, as well as Talent Attachment Programmes to private sector companies to better understand the impact of goverment policies.

#### We believe in facilitating your self-discovery

Every officer matters in the Public Service. We want to invest in their growth, enhance their lifelong employability and to partner them in their journey to achieve their career aspirations.  
  
Public Service Career Coaches help officers identify their career goals, values, interests and skills, so that officers can align them with their career strategy.

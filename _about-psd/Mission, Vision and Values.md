<h4>To deliver excellent public services and enable effective government.</h4>

PSD stewards One Trusted Public Service by developing strong leadership &amp; engaged officers; building future-ready organisations and promoting good governance


### Developing Strong Leaders

We select and grow leaders. We strengthen leadership abilities, behaviours and values at all levels. We identify, groom and appoint top leaders across the Public Service. We build a strong and united leadership community, bounded by a collective vision, and centered on the right values and ethos.

### Building Future-Ready Organisations

We build capabilities at individual, team and organisational levels to directly address work challenges that public officers will face, and enable the Public Service to be ready for the future. Examples include putting in place individual development plans; and building engineering and service delivery capabilities.

### Promoting Good Governance
    
We lead the way in what good government is about, how public organisations ought to run, and how they should act to meet citizensâ€™ needs. We serve as guardians of Public Service values and ethos, and we safeguard and uphold the reputation of the Public Service. We provide sound advice on the structure of government.

**Public Service job application forms do not ask for race**

We thank Mr Raymond Anthony Fernando for his letter “Remove race declaration on job application forms” (TODAY, 23 May)  
  
In support of the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP), Public Service application forms do not ask for a candidate’s race. Mr Fernando may also like to know that public agencies endorsed the Pledge of Fair Employment Practices in April 2007.

**More than one way to apply for public sector jobs**

We thank Mr David Kwok Ng Kan for his feedback in his letter “Internet job applications not elder-friendly” (28 April).

The [Careers@Gov](mailto:Careers@Gov) portal offers a convenient way for candidates to apply for public sector jobs through the Internet. An applicant applying for multiple vacancies within the portal needs only fill the form once. The portal also serves as a depository so that applicants can update their career history and other information any time. 

This said, candidates also have the option of applying for public sector jobs via email and by post too. So there are several ways for applicants to submit their applications.

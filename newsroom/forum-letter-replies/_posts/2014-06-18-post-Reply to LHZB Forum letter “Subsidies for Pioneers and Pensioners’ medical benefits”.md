**Pioneer Generation Package benefits applicable to pensioners too**

We refer to Mr Zhou Quan Sheng’s letter “Subsidies for Pioneers and Pensioners’ medical benefits” (24 May) where he asked whether Government pensioners are eligible for the Pioneer Generation Package, including the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), and if the Pioneer Generation Package covers hospitalisation costs.

The Pioneer Generation Package has three key components – outpatient care subsidies, Medisave top-ups and MediShield Life premium subsidies. All Singaporeans who meet the Pioneer Generation criteria, including Government pensioners, will be eligible for the Package for life.

We recognise that Pioneers who are Government pensioners already enjoy significant pension benefits for inpatient and outpatient bills today. For this group, they will still be able to enjoy the following Pioneer Generation Package components on top of their medical pension benefits:

1.  Enhanced Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) subsidies for medical and dental treatment at participating GP and dental clinics.
2.  Lifelong annual Medisave top-ups of $200-$800.
3.  $100 per month, if they have moderate to severe functional disabilities.

With their pension medical benefits and additional benefits under the Pioneer Generation Package, Pioneers who are Government pensioners will see lower overall out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare. 

For more information on the Pioneer Generation Package, please call 1800-222-2888, or visit [www.pioneers.sg](http://www.pioneers.sg/).

Thank you.

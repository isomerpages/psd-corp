**Public Sector Recruits Based on Overall Job Fit**

We thank Mr Richmond Lee for his letter, “Explore ways to better gauge civil service hires” (Today, 14 April).

Public sector agencies do not recruit solely based on academic grades or qualifications. For applicants without any working experience, academic grades are used as a proxy to assess their suitability for a position in the absence of other criteria. Where applicants have prior working experience, relevant experience and technical know-how will be given greater consideration together with other qualities such as leadership, teamwork and customer orientation. As suggested by Mr Lee, job applicants can attach their resume outlining their work experience as well as references to accompany their application.

Shortlisted applicants, with or without working experience, will be interviewed to ascertain their overall fit for the job. Some public sector agencies also require shortlisted applicants to submit an essay or take a written test. The person with the best fit for the job will be employed.

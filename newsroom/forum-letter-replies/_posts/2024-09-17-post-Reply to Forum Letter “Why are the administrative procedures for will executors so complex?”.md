<p>We thank Ms Tan Ying Wen for sharing her experience on managing her late
father’s estate in the ZB forum letter, “Why are the administrative procedures
for will executors so complex?” (9 Sep 2024).</p>

<p>The Government is committed to continuously improve and deliver better
services for citizens. We agree with Ms Tan that more could be done to
support bereaved family members in managing post-death estate settlement.
Together with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, we will look into Ms
Tan’s feedback with regard to the settlement of a deceased’s banking accounts
and death benefits under insurance policies.</p>

<p>Launched in January 2020, Public Service Division’s (PSD) My Legacy@LifeSG
currently serves as the government’s one-stop platform for citizens to
access legacy planning and end-of-life related information and services.
Starting with the simplification of the death registration process and
the electronic download of the digital death certification on My Legacy,
the intent is for My Legacy@LifeSG to facilitate citizens to access more
post-death services on a single platform without having to go to multiple
Government agencies. PSD will continue to work on improving the effectiveness
and user-friendliness of My Legacy@LifeSG, and work with various stakeholders
to further streamline and simplify procedures related to post-death matters.
We hope this will help ensure bereaved families receive better support
during their difficult time.</p>

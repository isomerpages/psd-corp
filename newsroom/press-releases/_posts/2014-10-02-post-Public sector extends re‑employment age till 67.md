**Public sector extends re-employment age till 67**

From 1 Jan 2015, the Singapore Public Service will formalise arrangements to offer re-employment to all eligible officers till age 67. This will immediately benefit some 800 public officers turning 65 years old next year.

The Public Service Division has studied the recommendations made by the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers on extending the re-employment age.

As one of the largest employers in Singapore, the Public Service, which has 139,000 officers, will take the lead to re-employ officers up to age 67. This decision to extend the re-employment age by two years is taken in consultation with the ministries, statutory boards and public sector unions.

Public officers are currently re-employed up to age 65 when they reach the statutory retirement age of 62. Before today’s announcement, public agencies are already voluntarily re-employing officers beyond age 65, if the officers wish to continue working and they can contribute to the work of the agencies. There are about 1,000 public officers re-employed beyond age 65 today.

Mr James Wong, Deputy Secretary (Policy), Public Service Division, Prime Minister’s Office said:

“Re-employment allows the public service to continue tapping on our seniors’ wealth of knowledge and experience. It also allows our older colleagues to remain meaningfully engaged. In the Public Service Division, I am glad to work alongside several of our re-employed colleagues who, in addition to contributing to our work, also help to mentor and coach our younger officers.”

**Public service guidelines on re-employment from age 65 to 67**

The public service guidelines on re-employment take reference from the Tripartite Advisory on re-employment.

The guidelines state that eligible officers who wish to continue working, can do so on the same job with the same pay and benefits, provided the job is available. Otherwise, agencies will help the officers to find suitable jobs within or outside their agency. If no jobs are available, agencies will offer a payment to help them make the adjustment while they look for another job.

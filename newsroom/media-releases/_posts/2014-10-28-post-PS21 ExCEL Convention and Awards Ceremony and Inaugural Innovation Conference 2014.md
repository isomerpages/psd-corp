**PS21 ExCEL Convention and Awards Ceremony and Inaugural Innovation Conference 2014**

<u>**PS21 ExCEL Convention**</u>

The Singapore Public Service will kick off this year’s PS21 ExCEL (Excellence through Continuous Enterprise and Learning) Convention with a three-day exhibition from 28 to 30 October 2014. The annual PS21 ExCEL Awards Ceremony and an Innovation Conference will be held on 29 and 30 October 2014 respectively.

This year’s theme, _Today’s Ideas, Tomorrow’s Pride_, points to the importance of innovation in our daily efforts to create a better tomorrow for Singapore.

The three-day exhibition comprises 62 projects from across the entire Public Service. As part of the lead-up to the Convention, public officers will also participate in 55 Learning Journeys and sharing sessions hosted by various public and private sector agencies to understand the innovation practices in these organisations.

This annual Public Service event has been held since 1998. It showcases and celebrates innovative ideas, policies and projects from individual and team contributors, which create outcomes that benefit our citizens.

<u>**PS21 ExCEL Awards Ceremony**</u>

This year, the PS21 ExCEL Awards Ceremony will recognise 32 teams and individual officers who best exemplified the spirit of innovation and continuous improvement over the past 12 months (more details on the award categories and award recipients are appended in the Annex).

Mr Peter Ong, Head of Civil Service, will be presenting the awards for “Most Innovative Project / Policy” to 11 winners including the top three projects:

1 ) Institute of Technical Education’s Puppetry Robotic Glove System;

2 ) National University Health System’s Patient-Centred Medical Home at NUHS-Frontier Family Medicine Clinic; and

3 ) Singapore Land Authority’s Electronic Property Titles, you just can’t lose it!

Mr Ong said: “I am heartened that our public agencies continue to exhibit creativity in how they design solutions that benefit citizens. As our Gold award winners have demonstrated, designing our services with users in mind is key. For example, ITE-College West’s Puppetry Robotic Glove System has the potential to help stroke patients shorten their rehabilitation process and reduce their expenses, bringing hope and energy to patients and caregivers.”

<u>**PS21 ExCEL Innovation Conference**</u>

An inaugural PS21 ExCEL Innovation Conference, themed, People: The Heart of Innovation, will be held on 30 October 2014 and will focus on how the public service can work with our citizens and across agencies to co-create new, innovative services for Singapore and Singaporeans.

Public officers will learn from speakers from within the Public Service such as MOM and LTA as well as renowned private sector organisations. These speakers will be sharing their experiences in using different innovation tools and approaches to achieve better outcomes.

These initiatives are all part of the Public Sector Transformation effort to be “One Trusted Public Service with Citizens at the Centre”.

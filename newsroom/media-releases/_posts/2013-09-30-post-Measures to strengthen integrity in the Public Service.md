**Measures to strengthen integrity in the Public Service**

All public officers are expected to conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the integrity of the Public Service and public confidence in it. This includes not falling into financial embarrassment.

Restriction on casino visits

Following a review by the Public Service Division (PSD) to reduce the risk of public officers’ indebtedness from gambling, there will be some restrictions on officers visiting casinos, depending on the nature of their work.

From 1 October 2013, all public officers will need to declare within 7 days whenever they visit the local casinos more than 4 times a month or if they purchase an annual pass. For certain groups of officers, tighter rules will apply:

*   Officers who are in positions that expose them to the risk of being suborned and exploited, or whose misconduct will have significant reputational risk to the Public Service, will have to declare every visit to a local casino within seven calendar days.

*   Officers who enforce operations in the local casinos, or regulate the activities of or negotiate business arrangements with the local casino operators will be prohibited from visiting the local casinos, unless they are doing so as part of their official duties.

The existing rule prohibiting officers from gambling during working hours or on official premises remains.

Resources and help for officers

PSD has reminded agencies to help officers who may be in financial distress as indebtedness can put them at a higher risk of being exploited. As caring employers, agencies could assist by referring them to financial counselling or financial aid. There are also community groups such as One Hope Centre and The Silver Lining for agencies and officers to tap on.

Even as we provide help to those in need, we will not hesitate to carry out disciplinary actions against an officer once a case is made against him. In doing so, we will ensure that the proper process is followed and that mitigating factors, if any, are taken into account.

Mandatory job rotation and block leave&nbsp;

As part of the review, PSD also took the opportunity to look into strengthening measures to reduce the risk of fraud and corruption. Currently, some agencies with positions with high risk of corruption already practise job rotation. Some agencies also impose block leave as a fraud prevention and deterrence measure.

From 1 Jan 2014, job rotation and block leave will be enforced for officers holding positions which are more susceptible to being suborned and exploited if the incumbent were to remain in the same job for too long. Depending on the nature of their work, these officers will be subject to either one or both measures. Under the new rules, these officers should not serve in the posts for more than five years. Some of these officers whose work is more transactional in nature will also be subject to block leave of at least five consecutive working days per calendar year. &nbsp;Mandatory block leave is also practised in the private sector.

Background on the Code of Conduct

Every public officer has a duty to uphold the integrity and reputation of the Public Service and public confidence in it. Officers are expected to maintain the highest standards of personal conduct and integrity, and their actions must not bring the Public Service into disrepute or call into question its impartiality.

The Public Service Code of Conduct outlines the standards of behaviour expected of public officers in carrying out their duties.

The key principles of the Code that will help officers uphold the highest standards of personal conduct and integrity are:

To keep the Code fresh and relevant to deal with new challenges and circumstances, regular reviews are carried out, with the latest review having started in September last year. Public sector leaders held town-hall sessions with staff and their feedback has been incorporated in the updated and refreshed Code, which is being shared with officers. The Code of Conduct is a staff document for internal reference.

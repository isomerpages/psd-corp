**CIVIL SERVICE YEAR-END PAYMENTS**

**_Civil Servants to get year-end AVC of 0.7 month with the lower waged getting at least $1,000_**

Singapore’s economic growth is expected to remain subdued for the rest of 2012, with the economy expected to grow by around 1.5%. The electronics manufacturing cluster would continue to be weighed down by tepid external demand. On the other hand, expansion in the construction sector could provide modest growth support to the overall economy. In addition, growth may be slightly lower than forecast if the weakness in the externally-oriented sectors persists into the final quarter of 2012.

Against the backdrop of this more subdued global economic outlook, civil servants will get a year-end Annual Variable Component (AVC) of 0.7 month, with lower waged officers getting an AVC of at least $1,000. This signals the Government’s continued commitment to help low-wage workers.

The year-end AVC payment was decided in consultation with the unions.

Some 2,000 civil servants earning less than $1,430 will benefit from the minimum AVC payment of $1,000. For example, an officer drawing a monthly salary of $1,200 will get a year-end AVC of $1,000, instead of $840 based on 0.7 month of his salary. About 96% of these 2,000 civil servants are Division IV officers.

All civil servants will also get the Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance (NPAA) of one month, to be paid in December along with the AVC.

**Public Service improves career prospects for non-graduates**

_Faster career progression for Management Support Officers from October 2014; more graduate and non-graduate schemes to be merged_

<u>**Faster career progression**</u>

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his National Day Rally speech on 16 August, 2014 that the Public Service can and will do more to support the aspirations of non-graduates.&nbsp;

Most non-graduates in the Civil Service are currently hired under the Management Support Scheme. Management Support Officers can already progress to take on similar jobs as graduates, and be paid comparable salaries when they demonstrate the required performance and capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

From October 2014, Management Support Officers who perform well and are assessed to be ready to take on larger responsibilities can expect faster career progression.&nbsp; These officers can receive their first promotion in two to four years compared to the current three to six years. If they continue to do well, their subsequent promotions will also be faster.

<u>**More graduate and non-graduate schemes to be merged**</u>

PM Lee also spoke about merging more graduate and non-graduate schemes to give our officers the opportunity to progress on the same career track.&nbsp; Such single schemes of service are already available in several public agencies. In the People’s Association (PA), the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) and the Home Team Specialist Scheme, non-graduates and graduates enter at different points of their respective schemes. They progress in the same career scheme based on their performance and readiness to take on larger roles.

Currently, most graduates join the Public Service under the Management Executive Scheme. The Public Service Division is studying merging the Management Executive Scheme and the Management Support Scheme.

PUB, Singapore’s national water agency, is also developing a single engineering career path where diploma holders and Institute of Technical Education graduates can progress up the ranks, to take on wider engineering or managerial responsibilities.&nbsp;

Commenting on the review to improve career prospects for non-graduates, Mr James Wong, Deputy Secretary (Policy), Public Service Division, Prime Minister’s Office, said:

“While fresh graduate and non-graduate officers are appointed at different starting salaries, it is their job performance and relevant skills that determine their career progression. As long as an officer does his work well and shows the potential to take on larger responsibilities, he will move up the ranks whether or not he is a graduate.

“Or put it another way, graduates and non-graduates can now progress at similar rates, based on their level of performance and potential.

“We will develop good officers, for example, by letting them manage projects and lead teams. Opportunities for further education and training will be provided for officers to continually upgrade their skills, and help them to take on bigger jobs when they are ready.”

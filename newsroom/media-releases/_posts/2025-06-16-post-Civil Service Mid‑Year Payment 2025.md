<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Civil servants to receive 0.4-month mid-year bonus; Junior grade officers to get an additional one-time payment of up to $400</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong><em>This follows close consultation with public sector unions</em></strong></p>


<p></p>
<p>In close consultation with the public sector unions, the Government has
decided to pay all civil servants a mid-year Annual Variable Component
(AVC) of 0.4 month. Civil servants in grades equivalent to MX13(I) and
MX14 will receive an additional one-time payment of $250 while those in
grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, and those in the Operations Support
Scheme (OSS) will receive a higher one-time payment of $400. This mid-year
payment takes into consideration Singapore’s economic performance in the
first quarter of 2025, and the subdued economic outlook for this year.
Given the forecast of weaker Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and the
downside economic risks, the public sector unions and the Government will
jointly monitor the economic performance for the rest of the year, and
will calibrate the year-end payments accordingly.</p>

<p><strong><em>Economic and Labour Market Outlook</em></strong>
</p>

<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Singapore economy grew by 3.9 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the
first quarter of 2025. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has maintained
the GDP growth forecast of “0.0% to 2.0%” for 2025. The assessment takes
into consideration that the global economic environment remains clouded
by significant uncertainty, with the risks tilted to the downside.</p>

<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the labour market front, advance estimates from the Ministry of Manpower
(MOM) showed signs of moderating labour demand. Although the labour market
continued to expand in 1Q 2025, the pace of employment growth has slowed
compared to previous quarters and unemployment rates have edged up slightly
from December 2024. MOM expects the labour market to soften going forward
given the greater uncertainties weighing on business sentiments.</p>

<p><strong><em>Progressive approach to mid-year payment</em></strong>
</p>

<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Against this backdrop, the Government, in close consultation with the public
sector unions, has decided to pay all civil servants a mid-year AVC of
0.4 month. Taking a progressive approach to the mid-year payment, civil
servants in grades equivalent to MX13(I) and MX14 will receive an additional
one-time payment of $250. Civil servants in junior grades equivalent to
MX15 and MX16, and those in OSS will receive a higher one-time payment
of $400, as additional support.</p>

<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Government and the unions will continue to jointly monitor the economic
situation closely, and take into consideration the National Wages Council
guidelines which will be released later in the year in deciding the year-end
AVC payments.</p>

**Civil Service Mid-Year Payments** 

**Mid-Year Annual Variable Component of 0.5 month plus lump sum of $300 in July.**  

**In addition:   
Greater support for lower-wage civil servants.** 
  
Based on preliminary estimates, the Singapore economy grew by 4.4% in the first quarter of 2018 and is expected to grow by 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year1. Supported by sustained expansion in economic activity, the labour market improved slightly in the first quarter of 2018. Unemployment rates and retrenchments declined, while total employment grew slightly.  
  
Against this backdrop and taking into consideration the NWC’s recommendations, in close consultation with the public sector unions, the Government will be making the following mid-year payments:  
  
\- A mid-year Annual Variable Component (AVC) of 0.5 month and a one-off lump sum payment of $300 for all civil servants. Lower-wage civil servants in Grades IV and V of the Operations Support Scheme (OSS) to receive a higher lump sum of $500; and  
\- Built-in wage increase of $20 for civil servants in Grade V of the OSS, in addition to their annual increments.  
  
The above mid-year payments signal the Government’s continued commitment to support our lower-wage civil servants. Around 1,450 civil servants will benefit from the higher lump sum payment.  
  
The mid-year payments will be made in July 2018. The Government will decide on the year-end AVC payment for civil servants after taking into consideration Singapore’s economic performance in the second half of 2018.

The 6th Joint Seminar and 37th Public Service Games for Public Sector Leaders of Singapore and Malaysia will be held in Singapore from 12 to 14 September 2014. The Joint Seminar and Games allow the Public Sector Leaders to build on the excellent relationship between the Civil Services of both countries.

Mr Peter Ong, Head of the Singapore Civil Service, and 41 Permanent Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries and other senior civil servants, will host Tan Sri Dr Ali Hamsa, Chief Secretary to the Government of Malaysia, who leads a delegation of 31 Malaysian senior civil servants, comprising Secretary-Generals, military and police chiefs, State Secretaries and senior officials from the Malaysian Civil Service.

Mr Ong said: “Singapore and Malaysia are close neighbours and natural partners. The Civil Services of Singapore and Malaysia have always enjoyed a good working relationship. We both share the common goal of building a strong and innovative Public Service to serve our people and there is great potential for collaboration between the two Civil Services. I look forward to further strengthening our bilateral ties through such regular exchanges.”

This year’s Joint Seminar, which is themed “Public Sector Transformation”, will see an exchange of views between the public sector leaders of both countries. Besides the Joint Seminar, the programme includes meetings between the Singapore delegates and their respective counterparts, an official dinner hosted by Mr Ong, as well as friendly games.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Service Week (PSW) 2024 kicked off today with the presentation
of 100 Public Sector Transformation (PST) awards to agencies and officers
who have demonstrated exemplary efforts in service delivery, innovation
and developing themselves and their teams.
<p></p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year’s PSW theme is <strong>“Innovate, Grow, Care – Make a Difference for Tomorrow”</strong>.<strong> </strong>It<strong> </strong>reflects
the Public Service’s resolve to keep improving to deliver better outcomes
for Singapore and Singaporeans now and in the future. The Public Service
will do this by continuously innovating in our work, growing the skills
and competencies of our officers, and providing a caring work environment
where our officers can thrive.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the event, Minister-in-charge
of the Public Service Mr Chan Chun Sing thanked public officers for their
hard work. He highlighted the importance of governing responsively and
responsibly, so that Singapore and Singaporeans would continue to thrive
not just in the present but also in the future. He called on the Public
Service to retain its gumption to break new ground for Singapore. He also
called on officers to continually reinvent and reinvest their skills, to
enable them to seize new opportunities.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Chan also announced
enhanced benefits to better support public officers’ well-being and growth.
From October 2024 onwards, eligible officers in the Civil Service will
receive a $500 annual “FlexiGrow” benefit which can be used flexibly to
support officer’s health, well-being and individual growth. In addition,
all public officers can benefit from enhanced medical and dental benefits
from 1 January 2025 onwards. [See <u>Annex A</u> for details on the enhanced
benefits.]</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support officers who wish
to continue serving Singapore and Singaporeans, the Public Service will
also take the lead to raise the retirement and re-employment ages to 64
and 69 respectively from 1 July 2025, one year ahead of the national timeline.
This is in recognition that with higher life expectancy, many older officers
may wish to stay active, including being meaningfully engaged at work for
longer in different ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________________</p>
<h5><strong><u>ANNEX A</u></strong></h5>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Public Service Benefits</strong>
</p>
<p>The following enhanced benefits will be introduced to better support public
officers’ well-being and growth.</p>
<p><u>Introduction of Flexible Benefits</u>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To empower officers to take
charge of their well-being and growth, the Public Service will introduce <strong>“FlexiGrow”</strong> from
October 2024. This is a new $500 annual benefit that eligible officers
can use flexibly to support their health, growth, and well-being, based
on their own needs, such as courses for personal development and fitness
programmes.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Enhancements to Medical and Dental Benefits</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After close consultation with
the unions, the Public Service will enhance its medical and dental benefits.
The enhanced medical and dental benefits will also apply to re-employed
officers and Statutory Board employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officers currently enjoy outpatient
medical subsidies of up to $500 per year, with outpatient expenses at private
clinics capped at a $20 subsidy per visit<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>. To better support officers’ healthcare, the <strong>per visit cap for outpatient visits to private clinics will be increased to $50</strong> from
1 January 2025. With this, officers eligible for Healthier SG can also
better adhere to their personalised health plans with their registered
Healthier SG clinic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For dental expenses, officers
currently enjoy subsidies of up to $120 per year. This will be <strong>increased to $250</strong> from
1 January 2025 to encourage officers to visit a dentist regularly and maintain
dental health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We hope that the enhanced
medical and dental benefits will encourage officers to proactively manage
their health, in line with the national focus on preventive care.</p>

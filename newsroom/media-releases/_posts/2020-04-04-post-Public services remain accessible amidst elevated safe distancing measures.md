The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will be implementing an elevated set of safe distancing measures, as a circuit breaker to pre-empt the trend of increasing local transmission of COVID-19. The measures will take effect between 7 April to 4 May (inclusive) 2020.   
  
The Public Service will remain operational with majority of the public service workforce telecommuting. Government services will remain accessible to the public during this period, with digital services as the primary mode of service delivery.   
  
Essential services, such as national security, law and order, regulatory enforcement, government communications, public healthcare services, transportation, foreign affairs and embassy services, border control, civil defence, critical infrastructure, utilities, greenery and animal management and environmental services will continue.  
  
Key physical centres that provide help to needy Singaporeans, such as residential social services and social service centres will also remain open.   
  
With the implementation of the elevated safe distancing measures, the Supreme Court, State Courts and Family Justice Courts will hear only essential and urgent matters. All other matters will be adjourned until further notice. Further details will be available on the websites of the Courts by Monday 6 April 2020.  
  
To achieve the objective of safe distancing, the Public Service will scale down other physical counter service centres, defer non-urgent physical service appointments or temporarily switch to digital delivery. Digital and call centre services will continue to be accessible throughout this period. Members of the public are advised to access public services via non-physical channels instead and defer non-urgent visits to these public service centres.    
  
Public parks and stadiums will continue to be open as public spaces for the public to relax and exercise. In line with the objective of reducing social interaction to limit local transmission of COVID-19, all other public sector social and arts activities and facilities will be closed. These include SportSG facilities (swimming complexes, indoor sport halls, gyms and studios) and activities, community centre classes, museums, libraries and art galleries / performance venues.

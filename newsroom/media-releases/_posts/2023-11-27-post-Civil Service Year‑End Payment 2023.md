<p style="text-align:center"><strong> Civil servants to receive 0.6-month year-end bonus<br> Officers up to MX13(I) get additional lump sum of up to $800<br><br><i>This follows close consultation with public sector unions</i></strong></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In close consultation with the public sector unions, the Government will pay all civil servants a year-end Annual Variable Component (AVC) of 0.6 month. Civil servants in grades equivalent to MX13(I) and MX14 will receive an additional lump sum of $400 while those in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, and those in the Operations Support Scheme (OSS) will receive a higher lump sum of $800. This year-end payment takes into consideration that Singapore’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to come in at around 1.0 per cent in 2023, as well as the latest National Wages Council (NWC) guidelines.<br>

<b>Economic and Labour Market Outlook</b><br>

2.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The Ministry of Trade and Industry has narrowed the GDP growth forecast of “0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent” to “around 1.0 per cent” for 2023. The revised forecast takes into consideration the labour market outlook, subdued external demand for the rest of the year and continued downside risks arising from geopolitical tensions.<br>

<b>Progressive approach to year-end payment</b><br>

3.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Against this backdrop, the Government will pay all civil servants a year-end AVC of 0.6 month. In line with the NWC’s recommendations, the Government will continue to adopt a progressive approach in determining the AVC for civil servants. Thus, civil servants in grades equivalent to MX13(I) and MX14 will receive an additional lump sum of $400 while civil servants in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, and those in the OSS will receive a higher lump sum of $800.<br>

4.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In total, civil servants will receive 0.9 month in full-year AVC for 2023.&nbsp; Officers up to MX13(I) and equivalent will receive an additional lump sum of up to $1,200 in 2023. The Government will continue to pay the Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance (13th month) of 1.0 month to all civil servants.<br>

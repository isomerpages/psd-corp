&emsp; Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing co-chaired the 8th Singapore-China Forum on Leadership with Executive Vice Minister of the Central Organisation Department (COD) of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Jiang Xinzhi on 29 October 2021 via videoconference.    
  
&emsp; Prior to the Forum, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean met Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and COD Minister Chen Xi via videoconference. Senior Minister Teo and Minister Chen reaffirmed the close ties between Singapore and China. As part of Singapore’s planned transition, SM Teo handed over the Singapore co-Chairmanship of the Forum to Minister Chan. SM Teo, who had co-chaired the Forum since its inception in 2009, is confident that future editions of the Forum will continue to strengthen our close and long-standing ties with China, particularly as both sides adapt to a post-COVID-19 world.  
  
&emsp; The theme of this year’s Forum is “Risk Management and the Strategic Role of Leadership”. First held in 2009, the Forum on Leadership is a strategic platform for political leaders and senior officials of Singapore and China to discuss and exchange experiences on common challenges related to leadership development. The convening of the 8th Forum virtually demonstrates the strong ties and positive momentum of high-level exchanges between Singapore and China despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
&emsp; In his keynote address for the Forum, Minister Chan spoke on the common risks and challenges that China and Singapore face, and outlined his views on the governance approaches to better address them. Minister Chan also shared on the importance of good leadership in ensuring effective governance, and how Singapore seeks to develop a cohesive team of leaders with diverse skills and traits that complement one another. Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo and Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee respectively delivered remarks on the sub-themes of (a) Developing our Leaders’ Capabilities to Manage Risks; and (b) Enhancing Governing Systems to Manage Risks and Challenges.

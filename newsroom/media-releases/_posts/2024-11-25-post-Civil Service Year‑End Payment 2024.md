<p><strong>Civil servants to receive 1.05 months year-end bonus</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Junior grade officers get an additional one-time payment of $600</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>This follows close consultation with public sector unions</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following close consultation with the public sector unions, the Government
will be paying all civil servants a year-end Annual Variable Component
(AVC) of 1.05 months. Civil servants in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16,
and those in the Operations Support Scheme (OSS), will receive an additional
one-time payment of $600. This year-end payment takes into consideration
that Singapore’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to grow by around
3.5 per cent in 2024 as well as the National Wages Council (NWC) guidelines
for 2024/2025. The Government will continue to pay the Non-Pensionable
Annual Allowance (NPAA) of 1.0 month to all civil servants.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Economic and Labour Market Outlook</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Trade and
Industry has upgraded Singapore’s GDP growth forecast for 2024 from “2.0
per cent to 3.0 per cent” to “around 3.5 per cent”. The assessment takes
into consideration the better-than-expected performance of the Singapore
economy in the first three quarters of the year, as well as the latest
global and domestic economic situations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the labour market front,
the Ministry of Manpower’s labour market advance showed that total employment
continued to expand even while uncertainty in the global economy remains.
Unemployment rates and retrenchments also remained low amid a tight labour
market.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Progressive approach to year-end payment</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this backdrop, the
Government will be paying all civil servants a year-end AVC of 1.05 months.
In line with the NWC’s recommendations to uplift the wages of lower-wage
workers, the Government will continue to adopt a progressive approach in
determining the AVC for civil servants. Thus, civil servants in grades
equivalent to MX15 and MX16 and those in OSS will receive a one-time payment
of $600.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken together with the mid-year
payments, civil servants will receive a total of 1.5 months in full-year
AVC, with those in the more junior grades receiving total lump-sum payments
of up to $850 in 2024.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will continue
to pay the NPAA (13<sup>th</sup> month bonus) of 1.0 month to all civil
servants.</p>

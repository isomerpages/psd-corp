**Singapore and Australia Public Service Leaders exchange views at annual Roundtable**

The 4th Australia-Singapore Public Service Roundtable was held in Canberra, Australia from 23 to 24 September 2014.

Mr Peter Ong, Head of the Singapore Civil Service, led an 11-member delegation comprising six Permanent Secretaries, three Deputy Secretaries and Singapore’s High Commissioner to Australia. They are hosted by a 12-member Australian delegation led by Dr Ian Watt, Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

The Roundtable is a key platform for Public Sector Leaders to exchange views and insights on developments in their respective Services, and deepen the relationship between the Civil Services of both countries. Mr Ong said, “The Australia-Singapore Public Service Roundtable is an excellent platform for us to share different perspectives on public sector governance.

“We had a fruitful discussion on futures work and productivity in the public service, improving efficiency through shared services and the impact of an ageing population on the public service. It was also a good opportunity for us to ride on the momentum created by our leaders and reaffirmed our good relationship with our Australian counterparts.”

“We also had a good discussion on the sidelines of the Roundtable on progress towards realising a Singapore-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), which was launched last month in Singapore by the 8th Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee. The CSP will result in new levels of integration and enhanced cooperation between both countries who already share close relations, across a number of areas covering the economy, foreign affairs, defence and security as well as people-to-people. Both sides aim to sign a Joint Declaration on the CSP in 2015, when Singapore and Australia celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral relations.”

In line with the enhanced Marriage &amp; Parenthood package announcement by the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) today, the Civil Service, with a workforce of 77,000, will be implementing paternity, shared parental and child care leave enhancements.

These measures, aimed at helping civil servants balance work and family commitments, are effective from 1 January 2013, ahead of the Marriage &amp; Parenthood Package leave enhancements which will come into effect on 1 May 2013.

Mr Han Neng Hsiu, Senior Director, Rewards and Recognition, Public Service Division, Prime Minister’s Office, said: “We recognise that working parents need more support to manage their work and family responsibilities. The Civil Service’s early implementation of the initiatives from 1 January 2013 reflects our commitment to helping officers achieve better work-life harmony.”

<u>Paternity Leave and Shared Parental Leave</u>

The Civil Service recognises the significance of a father’s role in raising children and will make changes to paternity leave and introduce shared parental leave. Male civil servants with a Singapore Citizen child born on or after 1 January 2013 will see enhanced leave benefits.

Paternity leave will be increased from the current allocation of three days to one week. Eligible officers can take their paternity leave, either as a block or flexibly, within 12 months from the birth of the child.

An officer will also be given the option to share one week of his wife’s maternity leave, if she qualifies for the Government-Paid Maternity Leave and agrees to this arrangement.

<u>Child Care Leave</u>

Parents with primary school going children will also be helped. From 1 January 2013, parents with children between 7 and 12 years of age will have two days of child care leave per year to tend to their children’s needs. Parents with at least one child below 7 years of age will continue to have six days of child care leave.

<u>Adoption Leave</u>

Female civil servants are currently eligible for four weeks of paid adoption leave. This is already in line with the national move to make adoption leave a statutory entitlement under the enhanced Marriage &amp; Parenthood Package.

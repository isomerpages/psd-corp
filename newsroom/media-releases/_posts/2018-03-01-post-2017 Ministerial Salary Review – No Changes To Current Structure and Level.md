The Government will maintain the current structure and level for ministerial salaries, following a review by an independent committee in 2017 headed by Dr Gerard Ee.  
  
The current salary framework was introduced in 2012 following a review by an independent committee in 2011.  The 2011 Committee’s recommendations were debated and endorsed by Parliament in January 2012.   
  
The 2011 Committee had suggested reviewing the salary scheme after five years. Pursuant to this, the Prime Minister formed a fresh committee last year to review whether the current salary framework remains appropriate and valid against its intended goals; what adjustments may be useful; and whether there is a need to adjust the salaries should there be a change in overall salary levels based on the proposed framework.   
  
The 2017 Committee’s conclusion is that the scheme remains valid, but the Committee recommended adjusting the salary levels to match the updated benchmark, and also some fine tuning of the National Bonus conditions. The Prime Minister has written to the Committee to thank the Committee for its work and the well-considered recommendations. The Government has decided that since the scheme remains valid and the economy is still in transition, we will not change anything now and will maintain the current salary structure and level.   
  
The Government will review the matter again after five years or when it becomes necessary.   
  
On their recommendations, Committee Chairman Dr Ee, who also led the 2011 review said, “The 2017 Committee has found that the three principles adopted when ministerial salaries were first reviewed were sound and remained relevant. It is important to ensure that the right salaries are in place, as we believe that having the right people to lead Singapore will have a fundamental impact on the future of Singapore. However, we noted that since the reduction in salaries in 2012, Ministers’ salaries have not been adjusted to keep up with the benchmark for six years.”   
  
The nine-member 2017 Committee comprised experienced and well-established individuals from sectors spanning social and community service, business, trade unions and professional services (please see [Annex A](https://go.gov.sg/010318annexa))

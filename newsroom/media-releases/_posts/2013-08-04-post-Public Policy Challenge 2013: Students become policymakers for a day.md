**Students become policymakers for a day  
Public Policy Challenge 2013**

  
The Public Policy Challenge (PPC), a 24-hour case competition, saw some 60 university students step into the shoes of policymakers to plan for Singapore Budget 2022. To reflect the dynamism and unpredictability of policymaking, simulations were injected midway into the Challenge for the first time - participants consulted policymakers, stakeholders and field experts to clarify assumptions to be more precise in their decision-making process. 

The Challenge, organised by the Public Service Division, was held over the weekend of 2 to 4 August at InterContinental Singapore. Held annually since 2008, PPC is a residential case competition set in national policy context to raise participants’ awareness of the challenges involved in public policy development and implementation. Participants, tasked to address issues posed by a case scenario, had to consider the needs of stakeholders, manage trade-offs, and propose policy options. 

This year’s PPC drew a total of 91 teams comprising more than 300 Singaporean/PR students from universities in Singapore, UK, France, US, Canada and Australia. Some 16 shortlisted teams gathered this weekend for the semi-finals. The top three teams proceeded to the finals and presented to a panel of three judges - Ms Yong Ying-I, Permanent Secretary of the Public Service Division; Mr Ng How Yue, Second Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Trade and Industry; and Mr Chee Hong Tat, Chief Executive Officer of the Energy Market Authority.

The occasion was graced by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also Minister in charge of the Civil Service. He had a dialogue session with the participants and presented the prizes to the winning teams. 

Team Spark from Singapore Management University emerged tops and walked away with $3,000 in cash prize. The Doppler Effect and Multi-Polity from National University of Singapore were the first and second runner-ups, receiving cash prizes of $2,000 and $1,500 respectively. The three teams would be offered internships with the Public Service. The remaining semi-finalist teams each received a $400 cash prize. 

**About the Public Policy Challenge**

The Public Service Division (PSD) has been organising the annual Public Policy Challenge (PPC) in Singapore for students from local universities since 2008. PPC aims to raise the participants’ awareness of the challenges and dilemmas in developing and implementing public policy. Past participants have commented that the Challenge was enriching and had provided them with a good understanding of intricacies involved in public policy development. The  
Challenge also intends to give the participants an insight into a career with the Singapore Public Service. If the participants prove to be outstanding in the Challenge, they would be invited to participate in internships with the Public Service or apply for PSC mid-term scholarships or the Public Service Leadership Programme.

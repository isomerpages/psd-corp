The 5th Australia-Singapore Public Service Roundtable was held in Singapore from 24 to 25 November 2016.   
  
Mr Peter Ong, Head of the Singapore Civil Service, led a seven-member delegation that included four Permanent Secretaries and two Deputy Secretaries to host the Australian delegation. The seven-member Australian delegation was led by Dr Martin Parkinson, Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.  
  
Mr Ong said, “The Australia-Singapore Public Service Roundtable is an excellent platform for us to share different perspectives on public sector governance. We exchanged views and best practices on the use of data, on how to provide more tailored services for citizens and on talent development and management. It was also a good opportunity for us to reaffirm and deepen the strong relationship with our Australian counterparts which reflects the multifaceted nature of bilateral cooperation between the two countries.”  
  
The Australian delegation also paid a courtesy call on Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also the Coordinating Minister for National Security, and Minister in charge of the Civil Service.

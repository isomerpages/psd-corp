<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Civil servants to receive 0.45-month mid-year bonus<br>
	Junior grade officers to get an additional one-time payment of up to $250</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong><em>This follows close consultation with public sector unions</em></strong></p>

Following close consultation with the public sector unions, the Government will be paying all civil servants a mid-year Annual Variable Component (AVC) of 0.45 month. Civil servants in grades equivalent to MX13(I) and MX14 will receive an additional payment of $150 while those in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, and those in the Operations Support Scheme (OSS) Grades III and IV will receive an additional payment of $250. This mid-year payment takes into consideration both the better economic outlook and downside risks that remain in the global economy.

**_Economic and Labour Market Outlook_**

2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore economy grew by 2.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter of 2024, extending the 2.2 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the economy expanded by 0.1 per cent, moderating from the 1.2 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has maintained the GDP growth forecast of “1.0% to 3.0%” for 2024. The assessment takes into consideration that the external economic environment has remained resilient in the first quarter of 2024, although downside risks remain in the global economy.

3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the labour market front, the Ministry of Manpower’s Labour Market Report for the first quarter of 2024 showed that total employment continued to expand albeit at a moderated pace. Unemployment rates remained low and within the range observed during non-recessionary periods.

**_Progressive approach to mid-year payment_**

4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this backdrop and in close consultation with the public sector unions, the Government will be paying all civil servants a mid-year AVC of 0.45 month. Civil servants in grades equivalent to MX13(I) and MX14 will receive an additional payment of $150 while civil servants in junior grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, and those in OSS Grades III and IV will receive an additional payment of $250.

5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will continue to monitor the economic situation closely. It will take into consideration the guidelines by the National Wages Council which will be released later in the year, in determining the year-end AVC payments.

**Public Service Week 2014  
Serving the Nation and proud of it**

This year, Public Service Week will take place from 19 to 25 May for some 139, 000 public officers working in 16 Ministries and more than 50 Statutory Boards.

Started in 2008 as an annual event to build in public officers a sense of pride and belonging to the Public Service, PS Week reminds officers of the important role they play in nation building, and the need to serve with dedication and commitment. PS Week is also a time to recognise the good work of public officers and agencies, as well as members of the public who have helped and made significant contributions as customers.

Themed _“Walking In Step as One Public Service”,_ Public Service Week 2014 will be marked with a series of activities for public officers, including observance ceremonies, learning journeys, a tea reception at the Istana and an awards ceremony.

In this year’s Public Service Week video message to public officers, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also Minister in charge of the Civil Service, recognised the different ways public officers helped to make life better for Singaporeans, and thank them for their hard work. He said:

“Our officers dedicate themselves in so many different ways to making life better for Singaporeans and to make Singapore better. I would like to thank all of you for your hard work. We, like your families, are all proud of you. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to making Singapore better for all of us.”

DPM’s video message will be screened at the Observance ceremonies where officers will also renew their commitment to serve Singapore as One Trusted Public Service with Citizens at the Centre, through the Public Service Pledge (see Annex A).

The Istana Tea Reception will be held on 22 May. President Tony Tan Keng Yam will host about 650 public officers invited from agencies across the Singapore Public Service, including some 32 Long Service Medallists and 108 PS21 Star Service Awardees.

The annual _Excellence in Public Service Awards Ceremony_ will be held on 23 May with DPM Teo as the Guest-of-Honour. He will present 177 awards to public officers and agencies in recognition of their service and organisational excellence respectively, as well as to members of the public who have made significant contributions as customers (see Annex B for details on the award categories).

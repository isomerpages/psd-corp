The Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE), Public Service Division (PSD) and Civil Service College (CSC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to form the Public Service Cluster Training Committee (PS CTC) to mobilise the Public Service workforce to embrace skills-upgrading and help public officers reskill and be ready for future jobs and operating environments.   
  
The PS CTC aims to achieve alignment and action between public agencies and unions to effectively support workforce transformation. It will look across the Public Service to anticipate future jobs, skills gaps, identify jobs that will need to be redesigned, and develop training plans for public officers to remain employable and productive. In addition, the PS CTC will also look at strategies to help officers to learn new skills; such as digital know-how, design thinking, and systems thinking.    
  
The PS CTC will be co-chaired by Ms Teoh Zsin Woon \[Deputy Secretary (Transformation), Public Service Division\] and Mr Sanjeev Kumar Tiwari \[General Secretary, AUPE\] with Ms Ong Toon Hui \[Dean and Chief Executive Officer, Civil Service College\] and representatives from PSD, AUPE and NTUC as members.   
  
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by AUPE’s General Secretary Sanjeev Kumar Tiwari, PSD’s Permanent Secretary Loh Khum Yean and CSC’s Dean and Chief Executive Officer Ms Ong Toon Hui at the AUPE’s 60th Anniversary Dinner. President Halimah Yacob and NTUC Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng witnessed the signing.   
  
Mr Loh said, “The setting up of this Cluster Training Committee is timely as it helps the Public Service prepare our officers to stay employable over longer career spans. Our union leaders can complement PSD’s efforts by helping to identify training needs, promoting the take up of skills training among workers through their various branch unions, as well as advise members to be open to job transitions throughout a career within the Public Service.”  
  
Mr Tiwari said, “The Public Service CTC reinforces our commitment to enhance the employability of our public officers. It is a concerted effort between AUPE, PSD and CSC to level up training across agencies. This will ensure our public officers are equipped with the right competencies and mindset to take on new roles in the digital landscape.”

<p><strong>Speech by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Coordinating Minister for Public Services and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, at Spark: Public Service Festival Opening on 8 July 2025, One Punggol</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Transforming Public Service for SG60 and Beyond</em></strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good afternoon to all of you here at One Punggol and colleagues online.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This year is a special occasion for all of us. It is SG60. As with such
occasions, we always commemorate by looking back at how far we have come,
to understand why we are here, and chart out what we are going to face
in the years ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Our Journey Over the Past 60 Years</strong>
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Over the past 60 years, the Public Service has contributed much to Singapore’s
survival and success. Today, we have a Public Service that we can all be
proud of. We are highly regarded across the world, and have won many accolades.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our journey from survival to success has been built on three enduring qualities
shared by all generations of Public Service officers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, our boldness in pioneering new paths;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, our relentless pursuit of excellence in execution;
and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, our unwavering commitment to values and Singapore's
long-term interests.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These three qualities have seen us through key moments in our history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boldness, for example, shaped our nation’s foundations
in the 1960s and 1970s. Then, the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) made the
unprecedented move to turn swampland into industrial parks. The Economic
Development Board (EDB) ventured overseas to attract multinational corporations
to invest in an untested nation; we went on an export driven path when
others went for import substitution. We built up the Central Provident
Fund (CPF), Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB), National Service and
many other key institutions that continue to define the way we live and
earn our keep in the world. These are all examples of the pioneering spirit
by our previous generations. We did not just ask the question: What has
been done elsewhere? We asked ourselves: What new paths must we chart to
meet our own needs? This is one question we must continue to ask ourselves
every day. When there are no solutions, we must be bold enough to develop
new solutions for ourselves, and have the conviction to see them through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pursuit of excellence in the 1980s and 1990s,
this made the crucial difference between success and failures. Many people
have good ideas, but good and consistent execution with conviction is not
so easily achieved. The pursuit of excellence depends on a number of factors:
(a) consistency in execution; (b) vigilance to foresee potential problems;
and (c) constant fine-tuning to improve things even before they break.
These attributes were exemplified in how we built our infrastructure —
from flats to roads, from implementing CPF, to education and defence policies,
and many others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently in 2000s, we shifted and placed greater
emphasis in working together as One Public Service, anchored on the basic
concept of delivering our services from the citizens’ perspective — citizen-centricity.
What we saw during COVID-19, where all our agencies were able to work seamlessly
together, was not by chance. Our ability to work together as One Public
Service was honed through years of working day in and day out as One Public
Service, with constant fine-tuning and continually challenging ourselves
to do better across conventional Ministry or agency boundaries, to think
of the bigger picture and how we can optimise at the macro-level, in service
of our people and nation. This collaborative spirit is not something that
we should take for granted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I meet my counterparts from overseas, they often
share that while they have the same ideas to deliver services across different
agencies as a Public Service, it was not easily achievable. While systems
and processes can change, what was most important and needed to change
was the mindset to think as One Public Service rather than just to change
the systems and processes.</p>
<p><strong>Our New Reality: Navigating Complex Changes</strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are now entering a new phase of nation building and fundamental shifts
have emerged in the world. Let me share three challenges that we are confronting
as One Public Service.</p>
<p><em><u>Tightening Constraints</u></em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, tightening constraints <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">— from manpower to budget and carbon.</a> By
2030, one in four Singaporeans will be over 65, up from one in 40 in 1965.
This ageing will more than triple our healthcare spending from what we
spent just 10 years ago in 2015, and this will tighten our fiscal space
considerably. Then, there is climate change, which has introduced carbon
budget as a new constraint for us to manage. Many of these constraints
are interconnected, and therefore the solutions need to be developed holistically
and across different silos, achieving different trade-offs across different
domains.</p>
<p><em><u>Rising Expectations</u></em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, public expectations are rising. Today, when
you take out your phone to order a meal via an online delivery platform,
we are able to do it with a few clicks. This is what Singaporeans have
become used to. When Singaporeans transact with the Government and use
Government services, they expect no less, if not better. We will have to
rise to the occasion. But unlike subscribing to commercial services and
the convenience that comes with it, Singaporeans also have rising expectations
on how they can participate in the process and partner us in the solutions.
This is a good thing as it means there are opportunities for us to leverage
the capabilities and capacities of Singaporeans in general. However, this
requires us to rethink and rework our processes so that we can embrace
such forthcoming contributions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Businesses are similarly restructuring and reinventing
their operations more aggressively in the face of major economic disruptions.
What we need to do for citizens, we will also need to do for businesses
— making services more integrated and more seamless. These are also areas
the businesses are looking out for when they transact with the Government.
The expectations of businesses are similarly high. They will benchmark
us not just by how well we have done compared to the past. They will also
benchmark us by how well we are doing compared to many other jurisdictions.</p>
<p><em><u>Intensifying Competition</u></em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Singapore faces intensifying global competition.
Today, we can be proud that we are amongst the top in many of the global
indices such as quality of life, quality of Government services and so
forth. But we must be honest with ourselves that there are many jurisdictions
in different fields which have perhaps overtaken us in certain areas, and
there are many things that we can learn from them. For example, Estonia
has become the first country to fully digitise its Government services.
China serves over a billion citizens with artificial intelligence (AI)-powered
services. Our ASEAN neighbours are also making strides in digital innovation.
So, for us, standing still is not an option.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These are not just challenges that we must overcome — they are calls to
action for us to continue to hone what we have done well, to keep improving
so that we can stay ahead of the curve and competition to give Singapore
and Singaporeans the best chance to attract investments which will create
good jobs and pay good wages.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have often shared that my greatest concern is that we become complacent.
Success must not become the albatross for our future. We must be keenly
aware that with today’s disruptive technologies, many countries that were
previously deemed to be behind us can leapfrog what we have achieved over
many years. Look at the adoption of mobile services. The countries that
have adopted mobile services most aggressively and achieved some of the
best results are paradoxically the same countries that not too many years
ago were seen as the laggards in the adoption of fixed line telecommunications.
There is no room for us to be complacent.</p>
<p><strong>Our Path Forward</strong>
</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, what must we do as we take Singapore towards SG100? I think we need
to double down on what we have done well, and that is to continue to innovate
with citizens at the centre of all that we do.</p>
<p><strong><em>(I) Innovating as One Public Service with Citizens</em></strong>
</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first priority
is to take One Public Service further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about going
to visit a doctor today and imagine what we will encounter. Nobody enjoys
going to the doctors and having to be asked the same questions over and
over again. Everyone expects to tell the doctor once, and the record to
be shared across different agencies. This is the same standards we expect
across all agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have good
examples of what we have done. Not too long ago, when you approached the
social service agencies for help, you probably had to repeat your story
over and over again. We also had the problem of some Singaporeans being
over-served and some people being under-served. Today, with the Social
Service Net (SSNet), we have pulled many of our services together to be
much more seamless for those who need help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, we have
ServiceSG, including right here at One Punggol. We brought together 600
services from over 25 agencies under one roof. Today, when a senior citizen
visits ServiceSG for housing assistance, our officers can help to address
related needs like healthcare subsidies and social support, eliminating
multiple trips to different agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For businesses,
we have also established integrated platforms like GoBusiness which serves
as our one-stop platform for businesses to apply for licenses seamlessly.
Today, approximately 200 licenses across 26 agencies (around 50 per cent
of total licenses) are on GoBusiness. From this year, businesses can also
connect with the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) Pro-Enterprise
Office for support on cross-cutting regulatory matters. For residents,
we formed the Municipal Services Office to coordinate responses to estate
maintenance issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these are
examples where we have done well, but it also shows that there is scope
to go even further. For example, I mentioned that around 50 per cent of
total licenses are on GoBusiness. This means that we can continue to improve
with another 50 per cent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working as One Public
Service is not just about processes and procedures. It is also how we train
and develop our own service personnel to think One Public Service. The
mindset is the most important. With the correct mindset, we will be able
to run the new processes seamlessly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>(II) Optimising at the Whole-of-Government Level</em></strong>
</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the tightening
constraints that we are facing, our second priority is to optimise at the
Whole-of-Government level. It is not enough to optimise within our respective
agencies. We have to constantly look for new opportunities to work together
and use the resources that we have to achieve the maximum good for our
people and country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at One Punggol
where we are today. We have a swimming pool, library, ServiceSG and many
more. But was it easy to build One Punggol or Our Tampines Hub? At the
beginning, it was not easy. It required us to develop new processes for
different agencies to come and work together, to synchronise their requirements,
and sometimes to make compromises to deconflict their needs in order for
us to optimise resources. Imagine if we had done it differently, and each
agency continued to only do things for themselves. It would have cost us
much more. It would have required much more land. But most importantly,
our service delivery would be fragmented, and what the public sees and
enjoys will also be fragmented. Beyond Our Tampines Hub and One Punggol,
there are many other projects that we can learn from to optimise at the
Whole-of-Government level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give another
example. Previously, when it came to land planning, our instincts were
to have our own project. But increasingly, I am encouraged to see more
and more agencies asking how we can come together – not just to save money
and land – but how we can deliver an experience for the public that is
much more seamless and integrated. This is the direction we need to take
— looking at the big picture and not just at our own agency’s interest.
The tighter our resource constraints going forward, the more we need to
think broader and integrate our work and resource expenditure so that we
can achieve greater bang for buck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>(III) Developing Our Teams for Tomorrow</em></strong>
</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our third priority
is about people — how we take care of our people and train our people to
achieve all this. When we take care of our people, our people will take
care of our mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mission is to
take care of Singapore and Singaporeans for generations to come. Earlier
this year at the Committee of Supply Debate, I spoke about ramping up efforts
to help our officers build their career resilience and agility across different
life stages. Today, I am pleased to share that we are launching a Career
Fitness Movement to help all officers raise their career health by bringing
together three pillars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Equipping our People and Teams</u></em>
</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will equip individual officers to be more
career fit and teams to be more resilient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new series of Career Fitness training<strong> </strong>programmes
will be launched from July 2025 to equip all individual officers with the
skills and mindset to navigate across different career life stages. These
Career Fitness programmes build on recent efforts to shift towards competencies
in the Public Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>We are also stepping up efforts to build
stronger leadership teams, not just individuals. As we scale the use of
360 feedback, we are bringing together officers with deep domain expertise
alongside those with broad policy experience to create diverse teams capable
of addressing complex challenges. This intentional mixing of perspectives
helps us spot blind spots and develop more robust solutions. The composition
of a robust, resilient and diverse team is a leadership responsibility
that all of us have to undertake.</p>
<p><em><u>&nbsp;</u></em>
</p>
<p><em><u>Enabling Coaches and Supervisors</u></em>
</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we are strengthening our support systems
to ensure officers and teams do not walk this journey alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our enhanced network of career coaches – experienced
public officers who understand the challenges of public service – will
provide personalised guidance at every career stage to fellow public officers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also equipping our supervisors and leaders
with foundational career coaching skills and tools to conduct meaningful
development conversations with their officers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Empowering Systems and Processes</u></em>
</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we are building systems and processes to better
empower officers and teams to own their development and careers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new LEARN platform was launched in May and will
have features progressively added so that it becomes a 24/7 learning hub
where officers can access a comprehensive suite of digital learning anytime,
anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The One Talent Gateway platform will
also be scaled to most of the Public Service by the end of this year. This
will be a 24/7 personal career buddy that helps officers to identify their
competency gaps and explore an expanded array of career development opportunities
aligned with their aspirations. This includes Structured Job Rotations
(SJR) and our Talent Attachment Programme (TAP) beyond the Public Service.
Last year alone, over 5,000 officers participated in short-term attachments,
gigs, and job rotations. Another 1,200 officers developed skills while
doing good through the Public Service For Good movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together, these three
pillars create a holistic movement to empower our officers to strengthen
and extend their career longevity. This in turn will build the workforce
resilience of the Public Service. When each officer has the support and
opportunities they need to grow, our collective ability to serve Singapore
grows as well. This is how we will ensure our Public Service remains dynamic,
resilient, and ready for tomorrow's challenges. This is also how we can
continue to attract a fair share of the talent pool to join us in service
of our nation.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead: Creating Our Shared Future</strong>
</p>
<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking ahead, these
three priorities — (i) Innovating as One Public Service with Citizens,
(ii) Optimising at the Whole-of-Government Level and (iii) Developing our
Teams for Tomorrow — form an integrated strategy to tackle the challenges
of the future. One Public Service provides the foundation. Whole-of-Government
optimisation maximises our scarce resources. People development ensures
we have the capabilities to deliver on our ambitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But strategies do
not transform organisations — people do. We will require people at every
level to take action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaders must create
environments where innovation can flourish and teams can thrive. As the
Coordinating Minister for Public Services, my priority is to help build
a Public Service where agencies come together, facilitate trade-offs and
ensure timely decisions that translate into better experiences for both
citizens and businesses. Our aim is not to have an added layer like a joint
staff. Our aim is for every agency to be ready and able to take the lead
as first amongst equals when called upon. The hallmark of a good leader
is not how well you can defend your agency interests, but how well you
can bring people and agencies together to optimise for the greater good
at the Whole-of-Government level. Hence, my personal Key Performance Indicator
(KPI) is not how many projects I have coordinated or will need to coordinate
across public agencies, but how much we build a culture of everyone thinking
of how we can optimise at the Whole-of-Government level beyond our respective
agency, and how able we are to self-synchronise. The less I need to intervene
to coordinate, the prouder I am of our Public Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those of you who
have attended my meetings, you will see the following pattern. First, we
identify the problem, then we identify all the agencies that have a stake
in resolving those issues. Thereafter, we look for one agency to take the
lead while the rest of the agencies support the lead agency. For different
problems, different agencies will take the lead. For us to operate without
a joint staff, it will require all leaders at every agency to think Whole-of-Government
— that when I perform the role as the lead across different agencies, I
am doing it on behalf of the Whole-of-Government and not just my agency.
This is the culture and spirit that I hope to drive going forward so that
we can continue to have a coordinated and integrated Public Service. This
will keep the Public Service lean so that we can deploy forward to serve
our people and our country, instead of deploying these resources for internal
bureaucratic coordination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for this to succeed
is not just about me having this vision. I need your help and participation
to always remember that you are a leader in your own right, and you have
the responsibility to lead the Whole-of-Government effort in different
domains for different challenges. It is not just about me as your Minister,
or the Head of Civil Service (HCS) or one or two Permanent Secretaries
having to tackle this role. The power of the Public Service comes from
the fact that each and every one of you can be the person to take on the
first amongst equals role. It is equally important to understand that even
though we may not be the lead in a particular issue, we must still do our
part to support whoever is leading, because we will all take turns to be
the lead for different problems. So, I hope all our leaders and supervisors
will embrace this spirit, take care of our people and help them grow in
their roles — individually in their agencies and collectively as a Whole-of-Government.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me end with a
reflection on trust. The trust Singaporeans place in us is not inherited.
It is earned — earned by generations of dedicated public officers who came
before us; earned through countless moments where we put Singapore and
Singaporeans’ interests first. This trust is both our greatest privilege
and our heaviest responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But trust is not static.
It must be renewed and strengthened. How? This goes beyond improving processes
or adopting new technologies. Trust is earned every time we dare to do
something different for a better Singapore. Every barrier we break down,
every service we improve, every innovation we create — they all serve this
larger purpose of building trust with not just this generation, but with
future generations of Singaporeans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why your role
matters more than ever. Whether you are reimagining how we serve citizens
and businesses, developing tomorrow's leaders, or driving systemic change
— you are writing Singapore's next chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The qualities that
guided our pioneers must continue to guide us: (i) boldness in pioneering
new paths; (ii) relentless pursuit of excellence in execution; and (iii)
unwavering commitment to values and focus on Singapore's long-term interests.
These are not just words from our past — these are our compass for tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I want to
thank you for your service to the nation and encourage you to continue
to be bold in re-imagining how our Public Service can be. I hope that in
the future, you will be able to recall many proud moments when you have
innovated, optimised and taken care of people. So at SG100, we can look
back and say that this generation has continued to keep the Singaporean
Spirit alive, defy the odds and chart our own way forward, unshackled by
the history of the past, undaunted by the challenges, and ever imaginative
in thinking about what we can achieve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may be ordinary
people, but together as a team, we will achieve extraordinary things for
Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

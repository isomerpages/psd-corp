<p><strong>ADDRESS BY HEAD, CIVIL SERVICE LEO YIP AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE DINNER ON 26 MARCH 2024 AT MARINA BAY SANDS EXPO AND CONVENTION CENTRE</strong>
</p>
<p>Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean,</p>
<p>Ministers,</p>
<p>Chairman and Members of the Public Service Commission,</p>
<p>Colleagues and Friends,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Celebrations</strong>
</p>
<p>Tonight, we gather to congratulate 25 officers appointed to the Administrative
Service and 62 colleagues who have been promoted.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Let me also add my tribute to my former Permanent Secretary colleagues
– Ravi Menon, who retired in January, and Chan Lai Fung and Loh Khum Yean,
who retired last October. Having worked closely together for so many years,
I am very grateful to the three of them for their counsel, partnership,
and camaraderie. Let us extend our thanks to Ravi, Lai Fung and Khum Yean
for their many decades of significant contributions and send our very best
wishes to them and their families!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Adapting to change</strong>
</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tonight, I want to speak about a familiar topic, change. Let me set the
context by citing this quote from Justin Trudeau, Canada’s Prime Minister:
“The pace of change has never been this fast; yet it will never be this
slow again.”</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indeed, many big changes are happening, bringing disruption and challenges,
but also new opportunities. We can cite many examples, one for each of
the first four letters of the alphabet – Artificial Intelligence, Big Power
Contestation, Climate Change, Demographic Transitions, … and the list goes
on from there.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many of these changes are complex, like the transitions we need to make
to decarbonise our society, our energy mix, and our economy, all at the
same time. But if we can turn these changes into opportunities, we can
create a new sustainable and competitive economy for Singaporeans.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our own society is changing too. The Forward Singapore exercise led by
Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is a response to this, to strengthen
our social compact, by broadening opportunities for Singaporeans, as well
as providing support and assurance through every phase of life.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consequently, we in the Public Service must continually reinvent our thinking
and the way we work. We will need to perform new areas of work such as
in sustainability and develop new capabilities such as in digitalisation
and international work. We need to be more in tune with the ground as new
challenges emerge, and needs and aspirations evolve. We also need to pay
closer attention to execution and policy implementation because issues
have become more complex.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me talk about how our Administrative Service is changing; how the
way we develop leaders is changing; but yet how we must stay anchored on
the role we play within the Public Service, and the way we work with the
Political Leadership.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How the Administrative Service is changing</strong>
</p>
<ol start="9" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In response to these changes, Administrative Officers (AOs) will need
to do new work, build new skills, and have more varied experiences and
stronger ground exposure.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, we must better engage our partners in the private and people
sectors, as well as internationally, because challenges are now more multifaceted,
cross-border and interconnected. As AOs, you must build the competencies
to do so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This is why we have deployed more AOs to frontline and operational roles,
as well as to jobs that deal with international work.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have also started to give more of our AOs a stint in the private sector
to broaden their perspectives and experience. The number of AOs currently
posted to the private sector has doubled since 2019. The stock of AOs with
private sector experience has also doubled over that period.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, more AOs, around a third last year, are making additional
contributions in areas beyond their job roles, including volunteering their
time and effort in people and non-profit organisations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="11" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Technology is another area of rapid change, and we need new skills to
better harness and deploy advanced technologies. This year, we are starting
a training programme for all Permanent Secretaries (PSes), which will later
be extended to other senior leaders, to strengthen our digital tech competencies
in order to make better tech decisions.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individually, we must all be open to doing new work, developing new competencies,
gaining new experiences, and being exposed to new perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How our Leadership Development is Changing</strong>
</p>
<ol start="13" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Beyond the work we do, the Administrative Service is also a leadership
service. Officers are absorbed into our service, to be developed to lead.
Those who do not grow into leadership over time, will be better off contributing
in other schemes of service somewhere else in the Public Service.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the demands on our Public Service grow, so have the demands on leadership
in the service. We have thus in recent years strengthened the way we develop
our leaders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We have developed our own leadership competency framework. This framework
is tailored to the needs of our Public Service. It sets out the competencies
we expect in strategy, engagement, political sensitivity, and nurturing
staff, and also competencies in interagency work and driving Whole-of-Government
outcomes. This reflects the emphasis and expectations we have of our leaders.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also important that our leaders have regular and comprehensive feedback,
not just from those they work for, but also from those they lead and work
with. We have therefore deployed 360-degree feedback exercises for all
of our leaders, from middle managers right through to the PSes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 2020, we have conducted two rounds of these 360-degree feedback
exercises for PSes, Deputy Secretaries, and Chief Executives. I have found
the 360 results very instructive. They reveal feedback on our leaders that
were not evident before, and they give a fuller all-rounded view of our
leaders. We take these 360 findings seriously, and expect all leaders to
follow up on them.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have also conducted two rounds of Public Service wide Employee Engagement
Surveys since 2020. Together with the 360-degree findings of an agency’s
leadership team, we now have a rich and diverse dataset, updated every
two to three years, on leadership effectiveness not just of individual
leaders, but also leadership teams. If data is the new gold in this digital
age, all of us as leaders will do well to mine this gold.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="15" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Leadership effectiveness is critical. It can make or break an organisation.
It can lead a team to greater heights of achievement or take it to the
depths of despair. Poor leaders in our Public Service hinder our ability
to serve the public well.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of you here would either already be a leader or are being developed
to lead. The Service will continue to invest in your leadership development.
My call to all of us is to take these leadership development efforts seriously.
Have the humility to accept feedback on your individual leadership, even
if they make you uncomfortable. Dedicate yourself to developing and applying
your leadership competencies. Tap on the mentors in our newly established
leadership exchange network for support. As a leader, just as you want
to be proud of your team, lead them in such a way that they will be proud
of you as their leader. Individually, let us all work hard on our leadership
effectiveness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Thinking and Operating Whole of Government</strong>
</p>
<ol start="17" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>While we seek to make changes to respond to the shifts around us, one
aspect of the Administrative Service that is unchanging is that AOs are
regularly rotated to work across different agencies, in different sectors.
As a result, we develop a broad perspective and are therefore well positioned
to appreciate and apply a One Public Service or Whole-of-Government approach.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is another name that we coin for the Administrative Service,
I would suggest Whole-of-Government Service, but that makes all of us Whole-of-Government
officers, or WOGOs which suggests that this idea won’t go.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But it is with this Whole-of-Government mindset that we must develop the
competencies to organise and align other Public Service colleagues to work
together. As AOs, we must demonstrate and exemplify both the thinking and
action of working as One Public Service.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Working Closely with Political Leadership</strong>
</p>
<ol start="20" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Another unchanging aspect of the Administrative Service is that AOs work
very closely with our political leaders. We support the political leadership
in various ways. I will just cite three.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, we support our Ministers in taking the long view. This is a strength
of our Government — that we deal with today’s challenges but at the same
time plan and build the future for Singapore. This is how we have built
up our economy, our education system, a strong Singapore Armed Forces and
HomeTeam, and so on. This is also how we have built up and stewarded our
reserves. This is how we have ensured fiscal sustainability over the years.
This focus on the long term is a mindset, but it must be translated into
processes and action. In each of our agencies, we must keep a focus on
the long term, have planning processes to make sense of what lies ahead,
and then envision what is possible, exciting, and worth building, and how
to get there. We must then take these ideas and action plans to our Ministers.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, we provide honest advice to our Ministers. This is where we must
speak truth to power but, I would add, also bring power to truth. By this
I mean share the power of your conviction behind the ideas and advice that
you present to your Ministers. It must be the conviction in your advice,
as much as the persuasiveness of your argument, that helps our decision
makers to discern the right choices.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, it must also be with conviction that we implement the political
decisions that have been made, and the policy choices that have been selected
by our Ministers. This is how our system works — when the time for debate
is over, the time for action starts. And when a policy is worth implementing,
it is worth implementing well. Policy is implementation. But I would add,
implementation is conviction. And we can have this conviction because we
work so closely with our Ministers and understand the reasons for those
policy choices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion – Our System of Governance</strong>
</p>
<ol start="24" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Let me conclude. I receive regular visits from foreign counterparts who
come to understand how we do things. Very often, I am asked to explain
how to replicate the successes that Singapore has enjoyed.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I point to the principles that have underpinned our progress — meritocracy,
rule of law, racial and religious harmony, clean and good Government, competent
Civil Service, focus on the long term, and so on. Many of the things that
I have covered this evening.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But I would say to them, there is no one killer app, because all of these
have to work together within a system, one that is suited for their context,
just as our system is suited for our context. In our own context, this
system of governance is what has delivered good governance for Singapore,
producing progress, improving lives, and enabling hopes and dreams of our
people.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all work within this system of governance. This starts from our leaders
demonstrating the right values and setting the right tone from the top,
such as in the fight against corruption. Through our efforts in the Public
Service, and in support of the political leadership, we make this system
work. But we are also here to work to improve it. We do this by building
new capabilities, developing ourselves and our teams, rethinking our policies
and our work in a Whole-of-Government fashion, and always keeping a long-term
orientation while holding true to our convictions and values, in our ideas
and in our implementation.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In time to come, we will make a political leadership transition. It is
the responsibility of the Public Service and the responsibility of the
Administrative Service to continue to give our fullest support to the political
leadership and their priorities for Singapore. This is how our system works.
And this is how we must continue to help our system of Government succeed,
for the good of Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>

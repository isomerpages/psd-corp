<p><strong>TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH BY DPM HENG SWEE KEAT AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE DINNER 2025, 15 APRIL 2025<br>“6 LESSONS IN SG60”</strong>
</p>
<p>Minister Chan Chun Sing,
<br>Minister-in-Charge of the Public Service
<br>Chairman Lee Tzu Yang, and Members of the Public Service Commission,
<br>Head, Civil Service Leo Yip and Permanent Secretaries,
<br>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Good evening. First, my heartiest congratulations to the 13 officers who
have been appointed to the Administrative Service, and the 60 Administrative
Officers who have been promoted.</p>
<p>Five Permanent Secretaries have retired, or are retiring, from the Administrative
Service. They are Mr Chan Yeng Kit, Mrs Ow Foong Pheng and Mrs Tan Ching
Yee who has each served for 38 years. We were fellow Permanent Secretaries
when I was in the Admin Service. All have made significant contributions,
in various ministries. Ching Yee who worked most closely with me in MOE
and in MOF, was a pillar of support. Two younger Perm Secs, Gabriel Lim
and Jeffrey Siow, who have served 26 and 24 years respectively, are leaving
to pursue new challenges. On behalf of my Cabinet colleagues, thank you,
Ching Yee, Yeng Kit, Foong Pheng, Gabriel, and Jeffrey. We wish you the
very best in your next pursuits.</p>
<p><strong>SG60</strong>
</p>
<p>This year Singapore celebrates SG60.</p>
<p>In these 6 decades, the world and Singapore have gone through significant
changes, with many anxious moments – wars, financial and economic crises,
recessions, pandemics.</p>
<p>We are on the brink of a new trade and technology war, set off by the
strategic rivalry between the US and China. The world order of rules-based
multi-lateral trade in which we have found a footing for Singapore, is
being replaced by arbitrary and protectionist policies. History has not
only not ended, but has opened a new, dangerous chapter. The security and
economic consequences for Singapore can be severe.</p>
<p>Our ageing demographics and climate change are relentless pressures. Singapore,
as a little red dot, has been and will forever be, buffeted by developments
in Asia and around the world. At the same time, advances in Science, Technology
and Innovation will create new industries, disrupt and reshape existing
ones, and transform the jobs and skills landscape.</p>
<p>In all I have described, there are challenges, and also new opportunities,
depending on our responses.</p>
<p>Despite the twists and turns in the last 60 years, we have done well –
our economy has grown and ranks highly in competitiveness and innovation,
our external and internal security are sound, and our social cohesion is
strong. The quality of our housing, parks and greenery, and workspaces
is high.</p>
<p>Singapore’s success has translated to a better life for Singaporeans –
affordable and world-class education and healthcare, abundant opportunities
in different education and career pathways, and one of the highest home
ownership rates in the world – all within a City in Nature. We have beaten
the odds and risen from Third World to First.</p>
<p>Almost 2 decades ago, I went to Omaha to meet Mr Warren Buffet and Mr
Charlie Munger, to persuade them to set up in Singapore. Mr Buffet, with
a twinkle in his eyes, asked if he could invest in an asset that is based
directly on Singapore’s success as a country. Mr Buffet was most complimentary
and confident about Singapore. While I appreciate this, we must remember
that the survival and success of a ‘little red dot’, a small state, is
perilous. Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his founding generation grappled with this
at our independence. We continue to. It is a perennial issue, now and into
the future.</p>
<p>So let me take this occasion of the Administrative Service dinner in this
SG60 year, to share my reflections on six lessons, one for each decade,
in our nation-building journey.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 1: Execution is policy, and execution happens at the frontline</strong>
</p>
<p>When I started work in the Singapore Police Force, my first duty was to
patrol the streets in a police car, responding to ‘999’ calls. That evening,
there was a traffic light breakdown at a busy junction. When we arrived,
there was chaos. My teammate attended to one section of the street, and
I stood in the middle of the junction, the cross-roads, to direct traffic.
Soon, traffic built up as I could not see the traffic situation well. I
did such a bad job that cars on one side started horning me, followed by
cars on the other side! It was complete chaos. My teammate, an experienced
constable, took over, and immediately, traffic flowed in an orderly manner,
the horning stopped!</p>
<p>Now, I was a Singapore Police Force scholar, holding the rank of Assistant
Superintendent, just graduated from university, able to write essays about
the global economy and monetary policy, but completely incompetent in directing
traffic. In fact, I did not even have a driving licence nor passed the
Highway Code test! It was my teammate, a police constable, many ranks below
me who responded well to the situation. He had street sense.</p>
<p>It was a humbling experience. But I learnt an important lesson: serving
our citizens starts with the frontline officer. The frontline officer is
the contact point, the interface, between our policies and programmes and
their impact on citizens. Whatever our grand plans, execution happens at
the frontline, at the interface with our citizens.</p>
<p>As Administrative Officers, you work on the design of policies. You do
complex modelling and analysis. But if the policy intent is to translate
to intended outcomes, you must understand the chain of transmission – how
the policy is perceived by citizens, how it is transmitted, and how that
changes the behaviour of the individual or the group. And the frontline
officer, the interface between policy intent and outcome, is where the
rubber hits the road, where execution happens. Execution is policy.</p>
<p>So do your best, respect and develop the frontline, and spend some time
at the frontline. Perhaps Chairman PSC may set a new criterion that for
any Admin Officer to be promoted, you must pass a directing traffic test!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2: Leadership must have the guts and courage to experiment, to change</strong>
</p>
<p>One of a leader’s most critical task is in setting strategic direction,
and to be willing to change direction when the world changes, and the situation
demands it.</p>
<p>I regard two Commissioners whom I served when I was in the Police as outstanding
– Mr Goh Yong Hong and Mr Tee Tua Ba. Both were fighting secret societies
and organised crime in the 1960s and early 70s.</p>
<p>When Mr Goh was Commissioner, he observed that the secret societies in
the 1980s were more street gangs of listless youths, not the hardened,
organised triads of old. He decided to start rock concerts in the middle
of Orchard Rd, to let the youth have fun and to engage them. He started
the Police Boys Club, to experiment having healthy outlets for their youthful
energy.</p>
<p>Now, when Commissioner Goh first broached the idea, the senior officers
who were at that meeting – including myself – expressed concerns about
potential riots. Mr Goh chided us: if you cannot even handle disorderly
behaviour by youths, how will you ever handle serious riots – where are
your guts! Now the rock concerts went well, and we built a new relationship
with young people.</p>
<p>The other gutsy Commissioner I served under was Mr Tee Tua Ba. Having
tackled hardcore criminals in the 60s, he was exasperated that frontline
officers did not dare make decisions. They were just following what was
called PGO – the Police General Orders, that set out what should be done
in various situations. And worse, often asking for instructions from the
Ops Room Sergeant.</p>
<p>Mr Tee started an empowerment movement, to get officers at the frontline
to exercise discretion and to make decisions. He promised that as long
as you do not break the law, any mistake that you make would not be marked
against you. An honest mistake for trying is far better than doing nothing.
Building on this, we later moved to a problem-solving policing, to tackle
the root causes of problems.</p>
<p>Now my stories are almost 40 years old, and I am glad that the Singapore
Police Force, where both HCS Leo Yip and I served together for many years,
is continuing to make changes. But it started with these two courageous
leaders, who changed direction, from fighting secret societies and triads,
to engaging street gangs to turn them around, to building rapport with
citizens and enlisting them to be partners in maintaining law and order.
What a paradigm change!</p>
<p>A lesson for all officers is that we should not be slaves to our past.
Use the experiences of the past. When the situation changes, be prepared
to be bold, to have the courage to experiment, to innovate, and to make
a paradigm shift. And be prepared to empower your frontline. If they make
an honest mistake, encourage them to try again. That way, officers learn.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3: Turn Constraints into Opportunities, Small into Beautiful</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore faces significant constraints in many areas – limited size of
land and population, a small domestic market, and almost no natural resources
– we even have to import our water. But the Singapore Story is one of turning
constraints into opportunities, and small into beautiful.</p>
<p>Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew spent many years grappling with the
lack of land and water, and the lack of hinterland. Today, we have 4 taps
for our water supply – desalination, NEWater, water catchment through our
17 reservoirs, and imported water. The technology for those now spawns
new industries in membrane technology and water purification. Similarly,
good urban planning and greening of Singapore has turned this little island
into a City in Nature, and developed the skills that allowed us to plan
and build integrated township in China and other countries.</p>
<p>Our constraint of a small domestic market forced us to look outwards all
the time. By welcoming the best MNEs from the first world, Singapore leapfrogged
the region, and moved from Third World to First. When the Asian region
grew strongly, we embarked on regionalisation, with companies from Singapore
and around the world using Singapore as a base to invest in the region.</p>
<p>By not adopting a narrow approach of protecting our local companies, it
forced our companies to compete, to upgrade. Minister George Yeo initiated
the negotiation of Free Trade Agreements. Today, we have 27 Free Trade
Agreements, bilateral and regional, spanning ASEAN, China, Japan, Korea,
Australia and New Zealand, the US and EU, and new ones with the Pacific
Alliance and Mercusor in South America.</p>
<p>So while we are not spared the tariff measures by the US, thankfully,
most of the world still believes in the benefits of free trade. In the
coming years, I believe there will be significant reconfiguration of the
global supply chain and the global technological chain. This trade war,
and the experience of the Covid disruption, is causing companies from all
over the world to consider not just efficiency, but resilience and reliability.
Singapore as a major trade hub and logistics centre can make the best use
of the on-going digital revolution, especially in AI, to re-position ourselves
in this new configuration. We must deepen and widen trade and investment
relations with the countries that we have Free Trade Agreements, and seek
to emerge stronger out of this turbulence.</p>
<p>Having upgraded the relations with many of our partners to a Comprehensive
Strategic Partnership, in this age of trade and tech-war, let us position
Singapore as a Global-Asia Node of Technology, Innovation and Enterprise,
trusted, relevant and useful to the world.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 4: Think Long-term and Embrace Contradictions</strong>
</p>
<p>We have taken a long-term approach to governing, acting as stewards for
our future, and embracing apparently contradictory goals.</p>
<p>In 2020, during the Covid pandemic, as Finance Minister, I had to see
our Elected President Halimah Yaacob on five occasions, to brief her on
each of the five Budgets, and to seek her approval to draw on past reserves,
to support our workers and businesses. In total, we used some $40 billion
of past reserves.</p>
<p>While all Finance Ministers around the world supported their economies
and peoples during the pandemic, I am probably the only one who allocated
such a big sum without having to borrow a cent. This means our future generations
will not have to repay any single cent of debt. We have benefited from
the legacy of long-term stewardship by our founding leaders. Going forward,
our current and future generations of Singaporeans and our leaders must
treasure and preserve this legacy.</p>
<p>In our policy making, we have been able to embrace apparent contradictions
well.</p>
<p>During an immediate crisis, like the Covid pandemic, we responded swiftly.
During good times, we saved to prepare for crisis.</p>
<p>Mr Philip Yeo promoted the A*STAR scholarships to develop a core of Singaporean
scientific talent and brought in top names like Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner
to nurture them. He called it a Pro-local, Pro-foreign strategy.</p>
<p>When I was in MAS, I found that we had a dual mandate – to develop our
financial sector, and to supervise our financial sector to keep it safe
and stable. This appears contradictory, but it forces us to better understand
the risks and returns of what we do. And our development of our financial
centre is no accident — it is because of this very careful balance.</p>
<p>Singapore must create our distinctive competitive advantage, and this
ambidexterity in our regulatory agencies can be a source of strength, especially
in sectors where trust and confidence is critical, such as in healthcare,
food and drugs and finance. As F. Scott Fitzgerald once said, the test
of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas
in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 5: Promoting Active Citizenry</strong>
</p>
<p>Let me touch on the next lesson five on promoting Active Citizenry.</p>
<p>Since I entered politics, I have seen how citizens are better educated,
better informed, and wanting to take part in decision-making, in making
things happen. While there are a few with a narrow or self-serving agenda,
the vast majority are seeking to contribute to a more vibrant and caring
society, across different areas, including social welfare, business and
the arts.</p>
<p>This is a strength for Singapore. We must harness the creativity and energy
of our active citizens, and encourage active participation in policy-making
and in nation-building. Otherwise, we risk having a divided or apathetic
society. To sustain good politics, we must broaden the base of trust and
participation to the whole-of-society, so that every Singaporean plays
a part, and has a stake in our success.</p>
<p>My experience in launching Our Singapore Conversation, the Singapore Together
movement, the Future Economy Council, and, during COVID, the Emerging Stronger
Task Force have all been very fruitful. We learnt much about the concerns
and aspirations of Singaporeans, received many good ideas and feedback,
and we launched many useful initiatives together. Participants told me
that they have found it very valuable, to learn how we can co-create solutions,
and in the process, deepen trust and understanding.</p>
<p>More recently, PM Wong launched Forward Singapore to engage Singaporeans
directly to hear their views, and co-create solutions with citizens, businesses,
and the community on ways to strengthen our social compact.</p>
<p>As Administrative Service officers, you play an important role in engaging
our citizens, whether as individuals or as organisations, and in leading
the frontline officers whom you work with in their interactions with citizens.</p>
<p>I encourage you to widen your engagement, not just within your ministry,
not just even Whole of Government, but to the whole of society. If you
extend that even more broadly, to deepening partnerships with peoples and
nations around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 6: Deepen the trust between the Public Service and the political leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>This, in my view, is the most important of the 6 lessons.</p>
<p>Our Administrative Service, and the broader PSL and officers in the public
service, play critical complementary roles, working with the political
leadership who are elected by our people, to govern Singapore, to take
Singapore forward.</p>
<p>While the relationship between political office holders and the public
service has evolved, one critical quality has not changed – the high trust
and confidence that we enjoy, and our sense of common purpose of securing
a better future for Singapore, for Singaporeans.</p>
<p>As an Admin Service Officer, I worked directly under our late founding
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and later with George Yeo in MTI, and with
SM Goh in MAS. I have deep respect for them, as they did not pursue narrow
personal or political interest, but had the well-being of Singapore and
Singaporeans at heart. All were visionary and creative. I stayed in the
Public Service because I felt I was working with leaders whom I could look
up to, whose commitment to Singaporeans’ well-being inspired me.</p>
<p>In my Admin Service days, I worked closely with so many of you. We had
rigorous discussions at COPS, and in discussing how to develop our younger
officers. We were all committed to securing the long-term interests of
Singapore and Singaporeans, and in developing our successors.</p>
<p>The political leadership and public service each has different roles,
but in pursuit of a common purpose. I have spent 45 years in public service
– the first 15 in the Singapore Police Force, the next 15 in the Administrative
Service, and the past 15 in political leadership so far. So I have experienced
the transition first hand, from the Administrative Service to becoming
a Cabinet Minister.</p>
<p>When I was PS MTI, supporting Minister George Yeo, it was George who set
the strategic direction of pursuing FTAs, and building relations with and
persuading fellow Ministers in our partner countries on the value of FTAs
for each other. I supervised the details of each of our negotiations.</p>
<p>Then when I became Education Minister, I had the strong support of first
Ching Yee and later Lai Fung as my PSes. They built strong rapport with
our excellent team of educators at HQ and in our schools, and we had open
and rigorous policy debates. Till today, I am very heartened that our educators
and admin service officers would tell me honestly if my idea was flawed.
They had the courage to speak truth to power. I am also very cheered that
when I was Education Minister, I spent many hours visiting our schools
and our teachers, getting firsthand feedback. They too had the courage
to tell me what exactly was happening in our schools, and that was valuable
for me in making policy at MOE.</p>
<p>Similarly, at NRF, first Lai Fung and now Chorh Chuan would have rigorous
debates with me on how we could achieve impact with our investments in
R&amp;D.</p>
<p>In the coming years, political contestation in Singapore will become more
intense. I find it alarming to hear some political parties claiming that,
with a first-class public service, the public need not fear a change of
government.</p>
<p>I am convinced that no Minister can make effective policies for the long-term
interests of Singapore by focusing on political engagements or politicking
alone, and leaving it to the public service to design and implement policies.
If the political leaders I had served in my Admin Service days had done
that, and had no policy instincts on what makes Singapore tick, I would
have left the public service long ago. And so would many of my fellow permanent
secretaries. We stayed in service because the political leaders we worked
with share the same mission of creating a better future for Singapore,
for Singaporeans, and with clear strategic minds.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong>
</p>
<p>So let me conclude. As we celebrate SG60, let us continue to reflect on
the reasons for Singapore’s success, and importantly, how we can use the
principles we have learnt, to continue to forge a better future. The future
will be a turbulent one, but if we learn our lessons well, we can continue
to be successful.</p>
<p>I have mentioned 6 lessons, one for each decade of our independence.</p>
<p>Lesson 1: Execution is policy, and execution happens at the Frontline</p>
<p>Lesson 2: Leadership must have the guts and courage to experiment, to
change</p>
<p>Lesson 3: Turn Constraints into Opportunities, Small into Beautiful</p>
<p>Lesson 4: Think Long-term and Embrace Contradictions</p>
<p>Lesson 5: Promote Active Citizenry</p>
<p>Lesson 6: Deepen the trust between the public service and the political
leadership</p>
<p>The administrative service must be stewards of this legacy – and champions
of Singapore’s future. So lead with integrity, serve with heart, think
big and bold. And always put Singapore and Singaporeans at the heart of
all that we do.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

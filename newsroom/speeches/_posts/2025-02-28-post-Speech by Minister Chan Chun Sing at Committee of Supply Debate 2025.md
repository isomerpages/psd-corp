<p><strong>Speech by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister-In-Charge of the Public Service and Minister for Education, at the Committee of Supply Debate on 28 February 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>FORGING AHEAD WITH A CONNECTED AND CAPABLE PUBLIC SERVICE</strong>
</p>
<p>Chair</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We thank Members for their various questions and suggestions on how the
Public Service can do better.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let me first address the cut by Ms He Ting Ru. She asked how we support
exploratory scientific research and about our approach to quantum research.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Research and Development (R&amp;D) is a long-cycle endeavour, and any payoffs
will be more appropriately assessed over the long term, rather than the
short term as Ms He has suggested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In any research, particularly initial research, there will be many competing
ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For instance, the mRNA vaccines that were crucial in fighting COVID-19
are a good example. The vaccines were enabled by decades of work in mRNA
therapeutics, which many initially regarded as unpromising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No one knew then the role that it would eventually play in the global pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the nature of R&amp;D.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In R&amp;D, success requires carefully balancing continuity in commitment
and investment, with the ability to pivot decisively when the need arises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our National Research Foundation (NRF) takes a portfolio approach, supporting
R&amp;D across fields and at different levels of maturity, and applying
relevant programme management approaches. Let me explain that. There is
no one method in managing the complexity of different fields of research,
different levels of research, different maturities, or readiness-to-market
levels of research. It is not a one size fits all. Different research areas,
with different time horizons, different challenges will all require different
management methods.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We review our programmes regularly, pivot them when necessary, and double
down on efforts that show strong promise or when circumstances evolve.
We can only have such optionalities if we have built up our capabilities
and talent intentionally. &nbsp;I must also explain that in making such
decisions, we do not just rely on our own expertise. Because in many of
these emerging fields, we may not have all the expertise. This is the reason
why NRF and our research institutes make sure that they have extensive
global networks with different panels of advisors that can give us their
different perspectives for us to make a considered decision. We have different
councils comprising both local and foreign experts in different fields
to give us the advice that we need.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Quantum research is an example where we are doubling down after seeing
initial promise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ms He asked about possible technical approaches, including our current
areas of focus, as well as industry development efforts to build our quantum
capabilities.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, this domain
is nascent and dynamic. We will continue to adjust where needed and make
judgements taking into account the evolving landscape, our capabilities,
what we have achieved and what others have achieved. Also, we keep a keen
eye on where others are investing in so that we can focus on the areas
where we will have a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like
to assure members that the key Government agencies and research offices
are keeping a close watch on all of these internal and external developments
in consultation with both our local and international scientific panels,
and we are not wedded to any focal areas or approaches. But what we must
do carefully is to build up capabilities to allow us to have the suite
of optionalities to pivot or double down as the circumstances evolve.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Ms He’s suggestions,
we will be happy to take into account her suggestions, and if she has scientific
papers that she feels will benefit our considerations, we welcome her to
let us know and we will convey this to NRF and our panel of scientific
advisors to take a look at this.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More important than
just building our own talent pool and expertise, we must also grow our
ecosystem of research institutes, industries and workforce. When we say
this, I don’t just mean growing the capabilities in-house or only in this
country. Very often in today’s research and development environment, we
will need to leverage on the networks that we are able to have access to
in the global environment. No one country, not even the biggest countries
such as India, China or US, will work alone necessarily, in many of these
cutting-edge areas. And working together is what we are committed to do.
In a more fragmented world, we must also ride on the opportunity for us
to play the role of bringing people from different backgrounds together.
That is one area of our competitive advantage. This will then position
Singapore strategically to contribute where we can and take advantage of
the opportunities, be it in quantum technologies or other areas.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let me now address
Ms Hazel Poa’s cut on behalf of the Prime Minister, on the terms of reference
of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC).</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Poa would agree
with us that there will be an asymptotical limit to asking EBRC to keep
reducing the average size of Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs)
– that limit being one where all electoral divisions are Single Member
Constituencies (SMCs). The current terms of reference provide some stability
in our electoral landscape by having a balance in the proportion of GRCs
and SMCs. Having Members of Parliament (MPs) serving a broadly similar
number of electors on average as the last election will enable MPs in the
coming Parliament to continue to serve and represent their residents effectively.
This last point is what matters most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for greater transparency
for its recommendations, we discussed this extensively during the debate
on the Motion that Ms Poa and Mr Leong Mun Wai tabled in Parliament last
August. We do not intend to repeat the debate today. Suffice to say that
we should avoid imposing requirements or instructions on the EBRC that
are too prescriptive, but to give EBRC, which comprises senior civil servants
with the relevant professional knowledge and expertise, the space to do
their work independently and objectively, without fear or favour.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,<strong> Mr Melvin Yong </strong>asked
how we would prepare the Public Service workforce to tackle the multi-faceted
challenges of the future.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Public Service
has achieved much for Singapore and Singaporeans since 1965.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Today,
we are known for our efficiency, innovation and ethos – from meritocracy
to incorruptibility. For example, Singapore has been ranked within the
top five in the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators on Government
Effectiveness since 2014, and topped Oxford University’s inaugural Blavatnik
Index of Public Administration in 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Having said that, we are not complacent and must not be complacent. Our
world is changing rapidly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The once familiar rules-based international security and economic orders
are fracturing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Achieving survival and success for Singapore and Singaporeans will
require fresh approaches in the way we do things, not just internally,
but also in how we connect with the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our people’s aspirations, as Mr Yip Won Heng has shared, have also changed.
They have gone up, while our manpower resource base remains tight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We will need to constantly review the way we build capabilities, execute
and deliver.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Service
will focus on strengthening three areas this year:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>First</u>,
we must deepen our perspectives of the world and strengthen linkages with
partners beyond our Public Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Public service delivery does not happen in a vacuum, nor does it only depend
on us looking inward at our own issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat </strong>mentioned, for Singapore to remain
successful, our Public Service must deeply appreciate the fast-evolving
external context which we have to operate in. We must remain engaged with
our international counterparts through active participation in international
forums, exchange and training programmes. We must keep in close touch with
what is happening in many international agencies. Because the decisions
made there can have significant impact on what we can or cannot do, even
in our domestic context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is why we will continue to send our officers to many of these international
organisations for us to touch base with the latest thinking, and build
those networks that are necessary for our continued survival and success.
We aspire to send more officers beyond the Public Service and beyond Singapore
to understand and build those linkages to further the cause for Singapore
and Singaporeans. As an example, National Environment Agency (NEA) officer <strong>Khairunnisa Binte Yahya</strong> has
first-hand experience of this. She is attached to the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) as an Air Pollution Expert. She shares expertise and develops
solutions for air pollution with UNDP partners, enhancing Singapore's global
partnerships in environmental sustainability and climate resilience. Khairunnisa
has gained insights into UNDP’s strategies which informs our efforts to
improve Singapore’s air quality. More importantly, she has built up a network
which she can call upon in time to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As we prepare our officers for an increasingly complex environment,<strong> Mr Patrick Tay</strong> asked
about our efforts to prepare officers for lengthened career spans. We have
introduced a Public Service Career Coach Network and will be ramping up
our CareerFitness programme to empower officers to build career resilience
and agility across different life stages. One such officer is Latha Nadarajan.
A Personal Assistant at the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF),
she pursued her passion for social work by obtaining a Singapore University
of Social Sciences degree. After attending a CareerFitness workshop in
2023, she is now set for an attachment with Child Protection Services to
apply her new skills. To further reap the career longevity dividend, we
will continue to tap on the Public Service Retirees Network, which provides
job and volunteer opportunities, to harness their wealth of experiences
and add resilience to our system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Second,</u> and
in response to <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng’s</strong> question on coordinated
citizen services, we will continue to integrate our service delivery from
a citizen-centric perspective, rather than a silo-Ministry perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, our ServiceSG omni-channel strategy is not just about bringing
different services together. It is about how we rewire our processes to
deliver services more efficiently, and yet be more aligned with the way
our people expect their service journey to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As we continue to streamline and digitalise our services, we will certainly
not leave those less digitally savvy behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This requires a mindset shift from a Ministry or agency-centricity to a
people-centricity and whole of government perspective. It is a digital-first
but not digital-only service that we are aiming for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Third</u>,
we must <strong>strengthen team development</strong> for a more complex and
challenging operating environment. In the Public Service, we have always
focused on the development of an individual and this remains valid. Moving
forward, we will need to go beyond developing individuals and strengthen
the way we develop teams and compose them with diverse abilities, backgrounds
and perspectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our ability to compose teams with diverse abilities to resolve and pre-empt
problems is critical as challenges become more complex and interlinked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To this end, our Civil Service College will lean forward to help different
agencies to build stronger and more agile leadership teams to bring out
the best in our agencies to enable Singapore and Singaporeans’ success.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To recap, there are
three things we will need to focus on urgently this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>First</u>,
for our Public Service to maintain that sense of perspective, to not just
be able to understand our own challenges deeply but to have a view of how
the world is evolving; because the rules are changing fast. Unless we are
plugged in, we might be overtaken or bypassed by rules that are made beyond
our shores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Second, we will continue to focus our efforts to wrap services around citizens.
We aim for a more seamless service experience for all Singaporeans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Third, beyond building the individual, we must build our teams, to have
different perspectives, to be able to see things from different angles,
so that we can have more robust solutions. We need teams with the courage
and the know-how to pivot and change course when the need arises, to pre-empt
problems.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chairman, we do not
take for granted that our strong track record will naturally enable our
success tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed, we believe as a Public Service that we should be continuously vigilant
to our fast-changing world order and domestic expectations and constantly
challenge ourselves to evolve faster. It is not just about solving today’s
problems better, but about anticipating tomorrow’s challenges earlier,
to find those solutions before the problem arises. Only then can we be
more assured that we are able to overcome tomorrow’s challenges, seize
new opportunities to benefit all Singaporeans – and be a Public Service
that can continue to be the pride of Singaporeans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To be successful, we must maintain a strong, continuous and consistent
partnership between the political leadership and the Public Service, that
allows our Public Service to execute with consistency and conviction, without
fear or favour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is perhaps something that we have taken for granted. In many countries,
they too have people in the Public Service with strong convictions and
good ideas, but they do not necessarily have the ability to do this well.
This is something that we have, something we cherish, and a competitive
advantage for Singapore.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chair, I have shared
how we will deepen our external linkages, deliver integrated services and
strengthen our teams. If we do this well, I am confident that this will
be a Public Service that we can all be proud of and that will partner us
to SG100 and beyond.</p>

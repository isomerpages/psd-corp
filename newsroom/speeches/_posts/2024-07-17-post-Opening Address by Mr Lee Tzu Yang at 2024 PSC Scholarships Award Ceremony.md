**Opening Address by Mr Lee Tzu Yang, Chairman of the Public Service Commission at the PSC Scholarships Award Ceremony on 17 July 2024, Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre**


Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service
<br>Scholarship award recipients, families and friends
<br>Your Excellencies
<br>Distinguished guests and colleagues <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the Public Service Commission Scholarships Award Ceremony. It is a happy occasion for all here today — not only the recipients of the scholarships but also your families, friends and teachers. Congratulations to all of you, and especially to those who have helped and supported those who will receive their awards.

2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we have 54 recipients of scholarships from a range of 14 pre-university institutions, of which four are mid-term students from institutions of higher learning. We look forward to welcoming you into the Public Service as we look to build strength in key new areas.

3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One important area in the public sector we are addressing is sustainability. From an initial three PSC Sustainability Scholarships, this year we will award four scholarships. Although you will follow different disciplines in university, you will be involved in setting direction, building understanding, and steering the work of various agencies when you return. You will be key in bringing more Singaporeans on board Sustainability, which requires interdisciplinary understanding and implementation.

4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area in which we continue to build strength is from the diverse experience and interests of our new public officers. For Singapore to succeed, we need not only the brightest but those who can identify and meet the aspirations of all Singaporeans, as well as handle the range of challenges that the external world will throw at us.

5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would like future public officers to have diverse educational experience and international exposure. I am encouraged by the diversity of countries that our scholarship recipients are going to this year. The scholarship offers a great opportunity to go out and see the world to learn new lessons and practices and develop skills for what we want to do for Singapore.&nbsp;

6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28 per cent of our recipients this year will study in our local Autonomous Universities. They will have the opportunity to do part of their courses overseas through the different options that are offered by every Autonomous University. If they go on to do Master's courses, we will insist these are undertaken internationally.

7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from those studying locally, we will see 57 per cent headed for the United States and the United Kingdom. The remaining 15 per cent will study in other overseas universities, and this year, I am pleased to see more scholarships being awarded to outstanding individuals for study destinations that are not the norm for Singaporeans. Out of 54 recipients of scholarships this year, three will go to Japan, three to France, and two to Germany.

8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to express our appreciation to our foreign partners – governments and universities – who have partnered us to increase interest and uptake in studies in their countries. One partnership we have reinstated after a hiatus of 10 years is with the Japanese Government through the Monbukagakushuo (or Monbusho scholarship) and we will see more PSC scholars again studying in Japan.

9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important for our Public Service that we do not restrict our contacts to the familiar, tried and tested. Our talent must not fear new things, whether these be technology, ideas or people. Indeed we should look forward to and be excited by the opportunities provided through new languages, culture and contacts.

10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not minimise the challenges of living and studying in foreign countries. You will have our full support. We are willing to look at whatever help you require, including sending you on language and preparatory programmes, as well as support from the scholarship officers during your time away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To all recipients of scholarships today, your challenge is to refashion the norms of the university academic journey that has been ingrained over generations, to ensure that your journey widens your horizons and prepares you with both the depth and breadth to pursue service to Singapore. Be active and thoughtful agents in your own education. Do not succumb to the easy way out, to just do whatever others do.

12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, you will be expected by citizens to help anticipate and define tomorrow’s challenges and opportunities, as well as help design and implement successful approaches to them.

13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PSC Scholarship will provide you ample support and opportunity to try new approaches to defining and solving challenges, and building your skills, experience and networks.

14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I want to thank all of you for stepping forward to serve. Remember why you are taking this direction, as you take the next steps. Enjoy your student days, take good care of yourselves and each other, and keep in touch with your scholarship officers. They are there for you.

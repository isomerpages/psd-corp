<p><strong>Speech by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, at SPARK: Public Service Week Opening, on 10 July 2024, ITE College Central</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>A Forward-Looking Public Service, anchored by Purpose, Values and Gumption</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good afternoon to all of you here in ITE College Central, and to many of
you who are joining us online. Welcome!&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hope the video has tickled your minds. If we get to SG100, our country
and Public Service will indeed have achieved a significant milestone in
defying the odds of history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am reminded that most Fortune 500 companies do not even survive that
long. Make a guess – out of the Fortune 500 companies that we have now,
how many of them have consistently made the list for the last 70 years?
The answer is, only 49. In fact, the average age of a Fortune 500 company
has been decreasing. It is now on average about 20 years only. And if you
strip out the 49 who have done so consistently over the last 70 years,
the average age of the remaining 451 companies is even shorter, at less
than 15 years!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You might be wondering why I have compared ourselves to the Fortune 500
companies. Our GDP size will rank us probably at about rank number 18 or
19 of Fortune 500. So, if we do get to SG100, I think it will not be because
we start with the assumption that we will naturally and effortlessly survive.
It is more likely that we, like the officer in 2065, continuously ask these
questions every day: How can we continue to defy the odds of history? How
do we keep creating and reinventing ourselves to be relevant to the world?
How can we create new value propositions by turning constraints into opportunities?
How do we constantly and continuously turn divides into bridges, both internally
and externally?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How we answer these questions will determine our fate. As the video shows,
we can ask the AI assistant to trawl through the wisdom of yesteryears.
We can ask the AI assistant to gather all the information for us on the
competition, the challenges, opportunities, threats, and so on and so forth.
We may even ask the AI assistant to tell us the best leadership and management
practices out there. And like the officer in the video, we can ask the
AI to do predictions of the future. But I am not sure any version of generative
AI will be able to tell us what to do specifically, to secure our future
and our place in history. The best chance for us to survive the future
is to shape it, rather than to passively await it. And in case you are
wondering, this speech was not crafted by Pair or any AI assistant. It
is a short message from my speechwriter, together with my personal reflections
on our Public Service journey ahead and our ambitions.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, if we take a step back and look at ourselves today, we can pat ourselves
on the back and say that we have not done too badly as a Public Service.
We are certainly not perfect. But our standing – both locally and internationally
– is good. The Chandler Good Government Index (CGGI) ranked us top on government
effectiveness for the second consecutive year.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sometimes, foreign guests compliment us by asking if they can borrow our
Public Service for a year. But the truth is that whoever thinks that they
can borrow our Public Service for a year and achieve the same results cannot
be more wrong. The success of our Public Service is not defined or measured
by short-term goals, but by planning ahead for the long haul. We do not
measure our accomplishment in days or weeks, but more importantly in years
and decades. None of these could be done without the larger context of
stability, and partnership between the Public Service and political leadership.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So while we celebrate our successes, I also want us to ponder a very simple
question today. Will we, the Singapore Public Service, continue to be the
pride of our nation and the envy of others? If so, why and how?</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I will answer the question today in the opposite way. I think we will not
continue to be successful if we lose three things: first, our purpose and
sense of mission; second, our values; and third, our gumption.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Remembering Our Purpose and Mission</u></strong>
</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>First and foremost</u>,<strong> we must never lose our sense of purpose and mission</strong>.
What is our mission? I have chosen a very simple and short mission statement.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mission
is <strong>to build a thriving Singapore that provides hope and opportunities for all Singaporeans through the times</strong>.
I have reflected and chosen each term carefully to encompass the meaning
behind our calling in the Public Service.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First,
“to build”. This is an action-oriented phrase. It is neither passive nor
reactive. It is not about just preserving and maintaining what we have
achieved thus far. Instead, each and every one of us must take on the role
of a builder, a hunter or a pioneer – one who is always on the lookout
for opportunities to score and create new value propositions for ourselves,
not only when we are forced by circumstances to do so. I always say that
we have three levels of leadership responsibility. First, we can solve
problems, but that is basic 101. Second, we can pre-empt problems – that
requires foresight. Third, at the highest level, we must unleash the potential
of our people. And that’s why we build. &nbsp;</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second,
I have chosen the phrase “a thriving SG”. This means a growing, living
entity that is not bounded by geography, nor constrained or defined by
resources. Instead, it is about transcending our constraints through our
networks and the power of our ideas and delivery.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,
“hope and opportunities for all”, regardless of one’s background, starting
position in life, race, language, religion, strengths and weaknesses. “Hope
and opportunities for all”, because each and every Singaporean has something
to contribute and can contribute. It is our job to enable each and every
Singaporean to contribute and to feel a sense of contribution, that they
are part of a larger entity that will shape our collective future.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase
“all Singaporeans” is obvious. We are committed to serve all Singaporeans
and everyone who wants to be a Singaporean out of conviction.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Through
the times” implies sustainability to defy the odds of history — governing
responsively and responsibly, through good times and tough times.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My simple
wish for all our public officers is that we will always remember this mission
of ours – “to build a thriving Singapore that provides hope and opportunities
for all Singaporeans through the times”.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding
our accomplishments thus far, we are never and will never be complacent
to think that we are on auto-pilot maintenance mode. Indeed, every new
day brings new challenges for our generation. Every new challenge requires
us to re-examine our assumptions and approach to overcome, and to transcend
the challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are
by now all familiar with the “fragmenting global order”, the “fractious
social order”, and the “fragile economic order”. The question for us is
how to overturn the 3Fs into the 4Cs – a “connected global order”, a “cohesive
social order”, a “competitive economy” and a “confident people”.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we
are in the foreign affairs, financial, defence and security pillars, what
are our ideas to bring like-minded countries and companies together to
uphold existing rules and to develop new rules to strengthen our chances
of survival and to thrive?</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we
are in the social sector, how do we lead by maintaining cohesion amidst
a more contested socio-political environment, a less trusting media environment,
a public with higher and more diverse aspirations?</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we
are in the economic sector, how do we attract new investments, create new
and exciting jobs for our people? How do we keep everyone’s wages growing
amidst the more challenging global environment?</p>
<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in
all sectors, how do we inspire Singaporeans and assure Singaporeans that
everyone can have their place in our society, to make one’s contributions
regardless of one’s abilities?&nbsp; That indeed, our collective and diversity
of strengths define us, rather than just competing against one another
for our own individual accomplishments. We inspire Singaporeans to define
success by how they contribute to the collective good, beyond their own
individual contributions.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So clearly,
we have our challenges cut out. We will have to find our own way forward,
just like the generations before us. I am confident that so long as we
put our minds to these tough questions, we will get some good answers.
It may not be perfect answers, but certainly as good, if not better, than
what others can come up with.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must
always ask the right questions, the tough questions and never opt out by
answering the easy questions. Because it is the tough questions that we
need to ask ourselves that will challenge us, and inspire us to look for
those breakthrough solutions that will take Singapore to the next higher
level. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Anchored by Values</u></strong>
</p>
<p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Second</u>,
we must not lose our values — to put the nation’s and people’s interests
above all. Our core values such as meritocracy, incorruptibility and the
relentless pursuit of excellence have become even more important in this
uncertain world. The effectiveness of the Public Service depends on trust.
We must be trusted to be able to do the right thing, to do what it takes
to protect the public good.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upholding
integrity at our core also means we have to be honest with ourselves and
see the world as it is. The Public Service will not work well, if we are
always constantly afraid of what people say about us or how people perceive
us. We must have the competence, and the confidence, to create a better
future for Singapore and Singaporeans on our own terms, and not just constantly
look for immediate feedback on what we do. Because many of the things we
do may not see results in the short term. But we must have the confidence
and the conviction to keep pressing on when we believe something is right.
Go out, and convince fellow Singaporeans that this is the right path to
take. Mobilise fellow Singaporeans to walk this journey with us. Only then
will we be able to defy the odds and overcome the challenges for the long
haul.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
other hand, it does not give us any joy to see good people stumble and
fall. With every stumble, we must emerge stronger and more determined to
put things right and do it better the next time. Circumstances do not define
us. Our responses will.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must
defend and uphold our values through three interlocking layers. First,
we must continue to have an overall framework of clear rules that enable
our people to do the right things, and not just prevent them from doing
the wrong or bad things. Second, we must collectively endeavour to look
out for one another, and never think we are facing all the temptations
and challenges as individuals alone. Third, we must have a personal responsibility
to live by our ethos to serve and uphold our system and values for the
larger good of our country and people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Filled with Gumption</u></strong>
</p>
<p>30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I
come to my <u>third point</u>. The Public Service must not lose gumption:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gumption to break new grounds and find new
solutions in context for our challenges, rather than relying on others’
ideas, especially those that have not proven effective even in solving
other people’s problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gumption to see and pursue opportunities in
good times and tough times, in every challenge and constraint.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gumption to jettison less impactful work to
focus on purposeful work.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gumption to work hard at cracking our conundrums.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gumption to see the world as it is, rather
than as we wish or hope it will be.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gumption to admit that we are at
risk of complacency, that many others are working hard to overtake us,
and can overtake us if we drop the ball.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gumption to step out of our comfort zone, as
many of you today have demonstrated to master new technologies and processes.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gumption to engage other stakeholders when
we do not have yet all the answers or capabilities ourselves. All these
require our Public Service not just to do well internally, but we must
continue to do well with all our stakeholders together.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these
will only get harder. Not just because the world is becoming ever more
complex, uncertain and challenging. But they will get harder because the
longer and greater our success, the more difficult it is for us, or for
that matter, any organisation to jettison what has worked well in the past.
So like many other Fortune 500 companies or established organisations,
success can be the albatross, where we risk striving for perfection to
irrelevance.</p>
<p>32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we
do not check our blind spots and maintain our relevance, we risk falling
onto a downward spiral. If we are not careful, we will have our Xerox,
Kodak or Nokia moment. They were once successful pioneering organisations,
but today they are no longer in the pantheons of Fortune 500 companies
with great stories to inspire the next generation. These once successful
businesses should alert us to the dangers of complacency and how doing
the right thing is often more important than just doing the same things
well.</p>
<p><strong><u>Fuelled by Care and Growth</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Caring for public officers and creating the capacity for change</em>
</p>
<p>33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To continue
to do well for Singapore and Singaporeans, we must stay ahead of the changes
in our environment and continue to stay ahead by innovating. We know all
this too well.</p>
<p>34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
in an environment of constant change, we know it can be unsettling and
even exhausting for our officers. As I always say in the Ministry of Education
and in the Public Service, all of you pour your hearts out to serve but
you cannot keep pouring your hearts out to serve if you are not growing
or not being taken care of. We need to take care of ourselves; we need
to take care of each other in this long journey ahead. And this is what
our Public Service is committed to. I have been brought up by my commanders
with a simple saying that I always remember: We take care of the men and
women under our charge; the men and women will take care of our mission.
But we can never accomplish our mission if we do not take care of our own.
So, we will be enhancing the support given to our officers for their well-being.</p>
<p>35.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,
we rolled out the new Well-being@Gov programme this year. I urge you to
tap on the resources provided which include self-care resources, coaching
sessions, counselling, and so on. Beyond caring for your well-being, look
out for your colleagues too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>36.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also
want to empower officers to take charge of their longer-term well-being
and growth, based on their own diverse needs. This is why we will be introducing
“FlexiGrow” from October 2024. Eligible officers in the Civil Service will
receive a $500 annual benefit that can be used flexibly to support your
health, growth, and well-being. You will take charge and determine how
best you want to use these resources.</p>
<p>37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public
Service will also step up on our medical and dental benefits to better
support public officers’ health. From 1 January 2025, officers will see
medical subsidies at private clinics go up from $20 to up to $50 per visit,
while dental subsidies will go up from $120 to up to $250 per year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These
and many are hygiene factors. You have our promise; the Public Service
Division and the whole Public Service will do right by our officers, for
our officers. But I must say that all these hygiene factors alone will
not make us an attractive value proposition that can attract the best and
most committed people to come and join us. Instead, it will be anchored
on our sense of mission, our values and our gumption. That will inspire
good people to come and join us in service of our nation and people. The
greatest yardstick for our success is not just how we deliver for our country
and people now and in the future, but also how we can inspire the next
generation to want to come and join us in service of our nation.</p>
<p>39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being
in the Public Service is a calling. We will need to inspire a new generation,
both young and the mid-careerists, to join us in our mission. The ability
to contribute to and realise bold ambitions for Singapore’s future, and
our conviction to build a better life for our fellow Singaporeans and our
future generations will distinguish us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently,
I did a podcast with The Straits Times. They asked me, why join the Public
Service when there are so many other options and opportunities elsewhere?
And the simple answer is, there are many places where you can earn a good
income. But there is only one place in Singapore where you can join hands
with fellow Singaporeans to shape our future, our history. And that is
the Singapore Public Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mindset of continual growth</em>
</p>
<p>41.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this
note, the Public Service will be taking the lead to extend the retirement
and re-employment ages to 64 and 69 respectively from 1 July 2025, one
year ahead of the national schedule. We recognise that with higher life
expectancy, many of our older officers may want to stay active, including
being meaningfully engaged at work for longer. We will support all officers
who still wish to contribute and continue shaping the future of our country,
regardless of age.</p>
<p>42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all
the disruptions in our operating environment, I hope our public officers
feel the urgency to continually reinvent and reinvest in your skills –
to stay relevant in a world where change is constant; to be always more
than ready to harness the potential of new technologies, not just to do
things better but to do better things; and to seize new opportunities;
and to constantly build new bridges with people beyond Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep yourself
mentally curious. Be game to learn and try new things. We will continue
to push hard for lifelong learning and continual growth for our officers.
The Public Service has significantly stepped up its growth and development
opportunities, from formal training to hands-on development opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will
also include more regular rotation of our people across diverse sectors
in the Public Service to allow our people to be exposed to the challenges
in different sectors so that we can all work together as one community.
These opportunities will include short-term attachments, gigs, job rotations
and stints in the private sector. The take-up has increased five-fold in
the past two years. We also have the Public Service for Good movement for
officers to grow skills while doing good. We will continue to expand these
efforts on various fronts with your participation and support. &nbsp;</p>
<p>45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will
also harness technology to help officers chart their growth and development
plans more easily. By 2025, officers can use the One Talent Gateway (OTG),
an AI-enabled platform, to build up competency profiles, identify competency
gaps, access developmental opportunities, etc.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>
</p>
<p>46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but
not least, I would like to share the success picture in my heart. The crux
is not that we have a perfect Public Service which can get 100 marks in
everything we do. The crux of the Public Service is that we have officers
who will get things right, even if the chips are down, and get things done,
even if there are negative voices.</p>
<p>47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do
this, we must keep our ears close to the ground. We must never be populist
and sacrifice our long-term sustainability for short term expediency. It
is a delicate but important balance – to govern responsively for the short
term, and responsibly for the long term.</p>
<p>48.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me
end by congratulating all the Public Sector Transformation Award winners
today. You exemplify the spirit of Innovation, Growth and Care that we
want to see in our Public Service. If we have these values and ethos deep
within our Public Service DNA, I am confident that we can inspire the next
generation of public officers to come forth and join us in this unique
and meaningful career to shape our destiny in service of Singapore and
Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>49.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,
I want to thank all of you here and online for doing what you do. Our success
is never a given, but I am proud of the Public Service that we have today.
We are not complacent, and we know the challenges ahead of us. I am proud
that I have a team of officers, all of you, that will see through our challenges
in good times and bad times. It is one thing to do the right things when
times are good; it is yet another thing to do the right things even in
tough times, when negative voices are there. It is one thing to get compliments;
it is yet another thing to keep pressing on when there are no compliments.</p>
<p>50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,
I will end off with this little recap from a recent session that I had
with the Middle East Institute. One participant stood up and asked – Minister,
in 30 years’ time, how would you like the Singapore public to remember
you as the Minister for Education? My answer was – It is quite irrelevant
to me whether anybody will remember that there was a Minister for Education
called Chan Chun Sing in 30 years’ time. It only matters to me that in
30 years' time, we still have a thriving Singapore that provides hope and
opportunities for all Singaporeans.</p>
<p>51.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accomplishments
that we have today are not due to the hard work of this generation. Before
I took on this job, I went to see many of my predecessors. They all reminded
me – in particular one of them reminded me clearly – for all the good that
happens during our time in leadership, we should give thanks to our predecessors.
For all the things that do not happen well after our time, we should take
responsibility. May we always remember this, never to measure our contributions
nor our accomplishments by the here and now. We measure it in the years
and decades to come. And our greatest success, as Mr Lim Siong Guan used
to say, is when the job is done, our people did not say “you did it for
me” or “I did it”. Instead, our greatest accomplishment will be when the
job is done, our people say “we did it together”.</p>
<p>52.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank
you very much for your service to the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

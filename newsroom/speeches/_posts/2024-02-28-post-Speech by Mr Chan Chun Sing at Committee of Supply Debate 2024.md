<h5>Speech by Mr Chan Chun Sing at Committee of Supply Debate 2024</h5>
<p><strong>A Forward-Looking Public Service: Operating, Developing and Partnering for the Future</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Chair, we thank all members for your cuts, questions and suggestions for
the Public Service, and how we can do better. Indeed, today, we have a
Public Service that the vast majority, if not all Singaporeans, can be
proud of. But we in the Public Service are acutely aware of the need for
us to stay ahead of the game.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Mr Patrick Tay mentioned, technology is changing rapidly. The way countries
are organising themselves and their Public Service are also rapidly evolving.
We must be careful that we do not rest on our laurels. We must continue
to innovate, continue to want to do better, and come up with new solutions,
lest we be overtaken by others. And if we do not have a strong, committed
and innovative Public Service, it will not help us to inspire confidence
in investors and local enterprises to put their investments here to create
good jobs for our people.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Government believes that we cannot rely on today's or yesterday's
solutions for tomorrow's problems. We have to constantly look for new processes
and new organisations to meet tomorrow's challenges. A forward looking
and future ready Public Service is central to Singapore's success. Let
me share how our Public Service is going to operate, develop and partner
differently to ensure that we are ready for future challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Operating differently for the future</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me start with how we are going to evolve the way we organise ourselves.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasingly, our Public Service will be organised in a more mission-centric
way, given the complexity and interdependency of issues that many members
have mentioned. For example, to more effectively tackle climate change,
we set up the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) in 2010. This
has worked out well and borne fruit.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCCS has allowed us to sharpen our focus on climate change across agencies
in the whole of Government. For example, NCCS worked with the Ministry
of Sustainability and the Environment to develop the Singapore Green Plan
2030 to achieve our long-term goal of net-zero emissions. But behind that,
there was participation from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI),
Ministry of Education, Ministry of Manpower and many other agencies.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2019, to better harness the potential of technology, we formed the
Public Sector Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office (S&amp;TPPO).
We are seeing the fruits of this effort too.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, robots are increasingly deployed in buildings for services
like cleaning and security. But they cannot communicate with each other
because of different manufacturers having their own proprietary software.
This is inefficient. To drive the adoption of robotics and automation,
S&amp;TPPO worked with A*STAR and GovTech to adapt and deploy a universal
middleware for the Public Service. With this, robots from different manufacturers
can now communicate with each other and with lifts, doors and security
gantries to move autonomously around buildings. Successful trials have
been completed in Tampines Regional Library and the JTC Summit with the
National Library Board (NLB) and JTC. S&amp;TPPO is working with GovTech
and the Infocomm Media Development Authority to further test the product
with other public and private sectors.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet another example where we have become much more mission-focused and
mission-centric is ground operations. To improve efficiency, S&amp;TPPO
and GovTech are working with agencies to apply video analytics. Rather
than just focusing on each agency’s own CCTV video feed, S&amp;TPPO is
driving the consolidation of these non-sensitive feeds into a consolidated
video exchange before applying video analytics to the consolidated video
feeds. This can improve decision-making and response times, such as identifying
an overcrowding situation that requires intervention, or preventing worksite
incidents.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will continue to build on these successes to refine the way we organise
ourselves going forward.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In response to Ms Mariam Jaafar's earlier questions to Deputy Prime Minister
Lawrence Wong about centralisation, from a Public Service perspective,
centralisation is not the only way that we can allow better coordination
across the various agencies. In fact, depending on the problem and the
nature of the problem, we have different methods.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes we may start up a new agency, centralise, and put it under the
Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to incubate it. Other times, we may assign
one of the involved agencies to be the lead, as the first among equals
to coordinate. But that lead agency is like a mini joint staff. It must
have people participating from other agencies to support it. And our hope
is that over time, each and every one of our agencies, when tackling a
new problem, can be a mini joint staff where they can harness the energies
and capabilities and capacities of other agencies to come together. So,
it does not mean that every new problem that requires more coordination
needs to be centralised at the PMO, or needs a new agency to be created.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, let me respond to Mr Yip Hon Weng on how<strong> </strong>we reorganised
service delivery to be much more citizen-centric.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021, we formed ServiceSG to create a single touchpoint for citizens
to access multiple services across agencies. In the digital sphere, we
have made great strides in making services more intuitive, seamless and
relevant for citizens, and we will continue to improve. For example, Singaporeans
can use SupportGoWhere, a one-stop portal to find Government support schemes
and services. A key feature is the Care Services Recommender for caregivers
to find the support they need easily and conveniently. Another example
is the MyLegacy@LifeSG portal which helps citizens plan ahead for end-of-life
matters.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even as more services are digitalised, the Public Service is committed
to ensuring that our services continue to be accessible and inclusive for
all. Today, citizens can walk into the seven physical ServiceSG centres
across Singapore and access<strong> </strong>close to 600 services and
schemes from over 25 agencies. Seniors who have difficulty making online
transactions can simply walk in. Officers are cross-trained to help them
access frequently used digital services, and 70 per cent of citizens visiting
ServiceSG Centres in 2023 were aged 55 and above.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will continue to expand the network of ServiceSG Centres to prioritise
areas with higher demand and concentration of citizens, particularly seniors,
who require support with multiple digital transactions. Aligned with this,
two new centres will be established at Woodlands Civic Centre and Bukit
Merah Central by the end of 2024.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are whole-of-government service standards to ensure agencies uphold
a consistent and satisfactory level of service. To avoid cases falling
through the cracks, we have a No Wrong Door policy for any public feedback
received. We will continue to ensure that our policies, standards and practices
are inclusive to all.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For municipal services, the Municipal Services Office, coordinates across
agencies and town councils to serve residents.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For businesses, MTI and GovTech are continuously evolving the GoBusiness
portal to facilitate a globally competitive, pro-enterprise operating environment
in Singapore. The GoBusiness portal allows businesses to access services
across multiple government agencies by milestone moments.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are just examples of how the Public Service is organising and evolving
to be much more mission-centric and much more citizen-centric.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Developing a future-ready workforce</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me respond to Mr Patrick
Tay and Mr Melvin Yong’s cuts on their feedback on how public officers
need to cultivate different skillsets and perspectives to thrive in the
new operating context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the Service, public
officers can gain new skillsets from formal training courses and increasingly
through hands-on development opportunities. These range from short-term
attachments – what we call Short Term Immersion Programme (STIP) and Gig
work – to longer-term job rotations, or Structured Job Rotations (SJR).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The take-up rate has been
good. The number of officers matched to these opportunities jumped five-fold,
from 730 in 2021 to 3,700 in 2023. For example, ServiceSG Centre Head Ms
Umamageswari signed up for a STIP with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC).
With AIC’s Silver Generation Office, she engaged seniors to better understand
their concerns and share how the government can support them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are happy to report that
the people who have gone through this programme have found the cross-pollination
of ideas very useful. At the same time, it helps them to build the network
of relationships required for a much more responsive Public Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also deliberate in
exploring alternative modalities such as bootcamps and competitions to
generate interest in building new capabilities. To build data capabilities,
GovTech organises the annual Data Champions Bootcamp and Data Arcade Tournament.
To build AI capabilities, GovTech launched the Prompt Royale Award, a prompt
engineering competition, last year. This year, GovTech will launch a new
AI Champions bootcamp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public officers can also
expand their perspectives through exposure beyond the Public Service. We
are encouraging the public officers to experience the perspective of citizens
and businesses through stints in the private and people sectors, such as
the Talent Attachment Programme (TAP). Under TAP, EnterpriseSG officer
Clarence Tan was attached to DBS Bank’s Business Analytics team. There,
he learned how to operate with big commercial datasets to achieve an all-round
understanding of customers. These insights were helpful when Clarence subsequently
returned to EnterpriseSG to use data to further partner businesses on their
growth journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have set aside up to
40 hours per year for officers to pursue their own development opportunities
outside the public sector. For example, Ivy Lee from NLB volunteered with
Friends-in-Deed Counselling Society as a certified counsellor. In her journey
with three individuals over 10 months, she deepened her empathy and communication
skills. This helped her to become a more empathetic middle-manager in NLB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An effective Public Service
needs to operate well both locally and internationally. We are equipping
more public officers with broader international perspectives through exchange
programmes and deployment to international organisations<strong> </strong>at
all levels, where they fly Singapore’s flag high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give some examples.
Ambassador Rena Lee, who is the current Chief Executive of the Intellectual
Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), was elected as President of the Intergovernmental
Conference (IGC) on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) in
2018 when she was an officer in the Attorney-General’s Chambers’ International
Affairs Division. As IGC President, Rena built upon her strong international
networks and mastery of international law, which helped her build bridges
during multilateral negotiations. The success of Ambassador Lee’s presidency
has entrenched Singapore’s standing in the international community as a
thought leader in international law, and as an advocate for a rules-based
multilateral system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is Mr Daryl
Ong from IPOS who participated in the two-year Madrid Fellowship Program
administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Through
this, he built his network with other countries’ trademark examiners and
deepened his knowledge of the Madrid Protocol. Daryl transformed the way
trademark data is communicated from IPOS to WIPO to be faster and more
accurate. This has benefitted trademark owners in Singapore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to look
out for opportunities for our officers to be attached to international
organisations at all levels, including United Nations agencies, because
this allows us to understand the issues that are evolving at international
circles and we can better prepare ourselves to integrate and work with
these agencies in time to come.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Partnering differently for our future compact</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now beyond organising ourselves
differently and building new capabilities in our officers, we also need
to partner differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partnership is a key component
of the refreshed social compact under Forward Singapore. Strong partnerships
are anchored on trust. The Public Service has worked hard over generations
to earn the trust of Singaporeans, and is committed to a strong system
of governance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms He Ting Ru asked whether
our regulations or practices need any updates to ensure that our governance
frameworks are not compromised, and Mr Louis Chua asked about making asset
declarations public for Ministers. I have responded to these topics extensively
in past Parliamentary replies, but if I may, I will reiterate a few things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>35.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different countries have
different rules for their people and organisations, and as all of us will
agree, no one rule is a panacea to prevent corruption or lobbying. But
what we need to do is look at the system holistically, look at the outcome
that we have achieved and ask ourselves: “What is the scale and magnitude
of our problem?” Putting in new and more rules does not necessarily solve
the problems that we may not even have to start with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>36.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever we put in new rules,
we must be careful of any unintended consequences. For example, I just
checked the data that was quoted by some members about countries who have
adopted some of those more elaborate rules. In the Corruption Perceptions
Index, in the last five years, Singapore has been ranked consistently between
number three and number five. But those countries who supposedly have more
elaborate rules are actually ranked much lower. For example, the UK was
ranked between 11 and 20.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we look at how to make
sure that we retain the trust of our people, we must look at it at a system
level. And if I may reiterate what I have said previously, this must occur
at three levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we must make sure
that we select good people with the right values to understand not just
the letter of the law but the spirit of the law and uphold them. Second,
we must work as a system, as a team to make sure that we look out for one
another, check each other’s blind spots, and help to prevent one another
from falling into a situation where they might be compromised. Third, we
must have layers of checks internally and externally to pick up issues
whenever there are problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how we have managed
to keep our system relatively corruption-free and lobby-free all these
years. But no system is perfect, and the situation is evolving. Every time
we put in rules, there will be parties that will try to go around our rules.
We have to evolve our own rules to make sure that we are never complacent.
If we try to copy other people's rules, we must see what they have been
able to achieve versus what we have been able to achieve, and what problems
they have been able to solve versus what problems we are trying to solve.
And there is no magic answer to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also care for
the confidentiality of the information and the privacy concerns of senior
officers in the Public Service, including political office holders. Why
stop at the Ministers? Why not the Members of Parliament? Why stop at the
Permanent Secretaries? Why not the Directors? I think for every rule that
we put in, there are implications that we should consider carefully and
ask ourselves whether the price that we pay is commensurate with the problem
that we are trying to solve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>41.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Saktiandi Supaat also
asked how the Government can partner citizens better. The formation of
the Singapore Government Partnerships Office (SGPO) signals our commitment
to the next bound of partnerships and engagements. Beyond partnering on
issues that are already on the national agenda, we will engage citizens
to set the agenda.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are building from a position
of strength. We have already established a clear track record of engagements
and partnerships with the community, from consulting to co-creating and
co-delivering solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For lower-income families
and their children, we have moved beyond public consultations on government
proposals to proactively co-create and co-deliver solutions with the public.
For example, under the Growing Together with KidSTART initiative, corporates
and volunteers partner KidSTART Singapore to co-create fun learning opportunities
for KidSTART families and their children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the Singapore
Green Plan 2030, the Green Action for Communities (GAC) movement was launched
in 2022 to involve the community in co-creating ground-up sustainability
efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also strengthening
partnerships with the private sector. During COVID-19, many came forward
to help and co-create solutions together with the government. We are doubling
down on these new ways of working together. There are now 15 Alliances
for Action (AfAs) covering a range of common interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are formalising our partnerships
with corporates, such as the Memorandum of Understanding with the Singapore
Airlines Group<strong> </strong>last month to collaborate in areas such
as training and volunteer management in essential support care roles in
the healthcare sector. This will also allow the Public Service to surge
our capabilities in contingencies, by drawing upon capacities in the private
sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank Ms Denise Phua for
her cut on the Public Service For Good movement. I launched it in July
last year to provide public officers with opportunities to actively partner
citizens on a personal level. I am happy to share that in 2023, over 1,000
public officers signed up to volunteer their skills for meaningful causes
such as being a community befriender for low-income families and mentoring
Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>48.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Public Service-ITE
Mentorship Programme, Higher National ITE Certification students like Ryan
and Faris interned at GovTech for 20 weeks. GovTech officers Yeo Ken Chuan,
Zorel Chen and Supansa Tan noticed the interns’ enthusiasm for learning
and ensured ample opportunities for them to grow and eventually perform
as product managers with the Public Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>49.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2024, we will expand
the Public Service for Good movement to include a wider range of social
causes and initiatives. This will include skills-based volunteering opportunities
that empower our youths and families through mentorship, support seniors
in ageing well, and promote sustainability initiatives for a greener Singapore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past success is no guarantee
of future success. I have shared how we are going to evolve the way we
operate, develop our capabilities &nbsp;and partner others for the future.
This is an ongoing effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>51.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must look and plan ahead,
even if it means disrupting ourselves. In fact, we would rather disrupt
ourselves before other people disrupt us, so that our Public Service can
transform and remain relevant to the future needs of Singapore, and it
will be a Public Service that all Singaporeans can be proud of.</p>

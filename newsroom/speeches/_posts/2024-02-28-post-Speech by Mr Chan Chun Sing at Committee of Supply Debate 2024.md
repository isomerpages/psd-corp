<h5>Speech by Mr Chan Chun Sing at Committee of Supply Debate 2024</h5>
<p><strong>A Forward-Looking Public Service: Operating, Developing and Partnering for the Future</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Chair, we thank all members for your cuts, questions and suggestions for
the Public Service, and how we can do better. Indeed, today, we have a
Public Service that the vast majority, if not all Singaporeans, can be
proud of. But we in the Public Service are acutely aware of the need for
us to stay ahead of the game.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Mr Patrick Tay mentioned, technology is changing rapidly. The way countries
are organising themselves and their Public Service are also rapidly evolving.
We must be careful that we do not rest on our laurels. We must continue
to innovate, continue to want to do better, and come up with new solutions,
lest we be overtaken by others. And if we do not have a strong, committed
and innovative Public Service, it will not help us to inspire confidence
in investors and local enterprises to put their investments here to create
good jobs for our people.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Government believes that we cannot rely on today's or yesterday's
solutions for tomorrow's problems. We have to constantly look for new processes
and new organisations to meet tomorrow's challenges. A forward looking
and future ready Public Service is central to Singapore's success. Let
me share how our Public Service is going to operate, develop and partner
differently to ensure that we are ready for future challenges.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me start with how we are going to evolve the way we organise ourselves.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasingly, our Public Service will be organised in a more mission-centric
way, given the complexity and interdependency of issues that many members
have mentioned. For example, to more effectively tackle climate change,
we set up the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) in 2010. This
has worked out well and borne fruit.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCCS has allowed us to sharpen our focus on climate change across agencies
in the whole of Government. For example, NCCS worked with the Ministry
of Sustainability and the Environment to develop the Singapore Green Plan
2030 to achieve our long-term goal of net-zero emissions. But behind that,
there was participation from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI),
Ministry of Education, Ministry of Manpower and many other agencies.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2019, to better harness the potential of technology, we formed the
Public Sector Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office (S&amp;TPPO).
We are seeing the fruits of this effort too.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, robots are increasingly deployed in buildings for services
like cleaning and security. But they cannot communicate with each other
because of different manufacturers having their own proprietary software.
This is inefficient. To drive the adoption of robotics and automation,
S&amp;TPPO worked with A*STAR and GovTech to adapt and deploy a universal
middleware for the Public Service. With this, robots from different manufacturers
can now communicate with each other and with lifts, doors and security
gantries to move autonomously around buildings. Successful trials have
been completed in Tampines Regional Library and the JTC Summit with the
National Library Board (NLB) and JTC. S&amp;TPPO is working with GovTech
and the Infocomm Media Development Authority to further test the product
with other public and private sectors.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet another example where we have become much more mission-focused and
mission-centric is ground operations. To improve efficiency, S&amp;TPPO
and GovTech are working with agencies to apply video analytics. Rather
than just focusing on each agencyâ€™s own CCTV video feed, S&amp;TPPO is
driving the consolidation of these non-sensitive feeds into a consolidated
video exchange before applying video analytics to the consolidated video
feeds. This can improve decision-making and response times, such as identifying
an overcrowding situation that requires intervention, or preventing worksite
incidents.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will continue to build on these successes to refine the way we organise
ourselves going forward.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Operating differently for the future</strong>

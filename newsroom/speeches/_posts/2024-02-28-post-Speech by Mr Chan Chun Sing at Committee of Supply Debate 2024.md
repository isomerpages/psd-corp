<h5>Speech by Mr Chan Chun Sing at Committee of Supply Debate 2024</h5>
<p><strong>A Forward-Looking Public Service: Operating, Developing and Partnering for the Future</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Chair, we thank all members for your cuts, questions and suggestions for
the Public Service, and how we can do better. Indeed, today, we have a
Public Service that the vast majority, if not all Singaporeans, can be
proud of. But we in the Public Service are acutely aware of the need for
us to stay ahead of the game.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Mr Patrick Tay mentioned, technology is changing rapidly. The way countries
are organising themselves and their Public Service are also rapidly evolving.
We must be careful that we do not rest on our laurels. We must continue
to innovate, continue to want to do better, and come up with new solutions,
lest we be overtaken by others. And if we do not have a strong, committed
and innovative Public Service, it will not help us to inspire confidence
in investors and local enterprises to put their investments here to create
good jobs for our people.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Government believes that we cannot rely on today's or yesterday's
solutions for tomorrow's problems. We have to constantly look for new processes
and new organisations to meet tomorrow's challenges. A forward looking
and future ready Public Service is central to Singapore's success. Let
me share how our Public Service is going to operate, develop and partner
differently to ensure that we are ready for future challenges.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Operating differently for the future</strong>

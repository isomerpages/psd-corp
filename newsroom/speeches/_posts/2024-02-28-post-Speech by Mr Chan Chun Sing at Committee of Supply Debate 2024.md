<h5>Speech by Mr Chan Chun Sing at Committee of Supply Debate 2024</h5>
<p><strong>A Forward-Looking Public Service: Operating, Developing and Partnering for the Future</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Chair, we thank all members for your cuts, questions and suggestions for
the Public Service, and how we can do better. Indeed, today, we have a
Public Service that the vast majority, if not all Singaporeans, can be
proud of. But we in the Public Service are acutely aware of the need for
us to stay ahead of the game.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Mr Patrick Tay mentioned, technology is changing rapidly. The way countries
are organising themselves and their Public Service are also rapidly evolving.
We must be careful that we do not rest on our laurels. We must continue
to innovate, continue to want to do better, and come up with new solutions,
lest we be overtaken by others. And if we do not have a strong, committed
and innovative Public Service, it will not help us to inspire confidence
in investors and local enterprises to put their investments here to create
good jobs for our people.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Government believes that we cannot rely on today's or yesterday's
solutions for tomorrow's problems. We have to constantly look for new processes
and new organisations to meet tomorrow's challenges. A forward looking
and future ready Public Service is central to Singapore's success. Let
me share how our Public Service is going to operate, develop and partner
differently to ensure that we are ready for future challenges.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Operating differently for the future</strong>
</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Let me start with how we are going to evolve the way we organise ourselves.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasingly, our Public Service will be organised in a more mission-centric
way, given the complexity and interdependency of issues that many members
have mentioned. For example, to more effectively tackle climate change,
we set up the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) in 2010. This
has worked out well and borne fruit.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCCS has allowed us to sharpen our focus on climate change across agencies
in the whole of Government. For example, NCCS worked with the Ministry
of Sustainability and the Environment to develop the Singapore Green Plan
2030 to achieve our long-term goal of net-zero emissions. But behind that,
there was participation from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI),
Ministry of Education, Ministry of Manpower and many other agencies.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2019, to better harness the potential of technology, we formed the
Public Sector Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office (S&amp;TPPO).
We are seeing the fruits of this effort too.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, robots are increasingly deployed in buildings for services
like cleaning and security. But they cannot communicate with each other
because of different manufacturers having their own proprietary software.
This is inefficient. To drive the adoption of robotics and automation,
S&amp;TPPO worked with A*STAR and GovTech to adapt and deploy a universal
middleware for the Public Service. With this, robots from different manufacturers
can now communicate with each other and with lifts, doors and security
gantries to move autonomously around buildings. Successful trials have
been completed in Tampines Regional Library and the JTC Summit with the
National Library Board (NLB) and JTC. S&amp;TPPO is working with GovTech
and the Infocomm Media Development Authority to further test the product
with other public and private sectors.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet another example where we have become much more mission-focused and
mission-centric is ground operations. To improve efficiency, S&amp;TPPO
and GovTech are working with agencies to apply video analytics. Rather
than just focusing on each agency’s own CCTV video feed, S&amp;TPPO is
driving the consolidation of these non-sensitive feeds into a consolidated
video exchange before applying video analytics to the consolidated video
feeds. This can improve decision-making and response times, such as identifying
an overcrowding situation that requires intervention, or preventing worksite
incidents.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will continue to build on these successes to refine the way we organise
ourselves going forward.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In response to Ms Mariam Jaafar's earlier questions to Deputy Prime Minister
Lawrence Wong about centralisation, from a Public Service perspective,
centralisation is not the only way that we can allow better coordination
across the various agencies. In fact, depending on the problem and the
nature of the problem, we have different methods.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes we may start up a new agency, centralise, and put it under the
Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to incubate it. Other times, we may assign
one of the involved agencies to be the lead, as the first among equals
to coordinate. But that lead agency is like a mini joint staff. It must
have people participating from other agencies to support it. And our hope
is that over time, each and every one of our agencies, when tackling a
new problem, can be a mini joint staff where they can harness the energies
and capabilities and capacities of other agencies to come together. So,
it does not mean that every new problem that requires more coordination
needs to be centralised at the PMO, or needs a new agency to be created.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, let me respond to Mr Yip Hon Weng on how<strong> </strong>we reorganised
service delivery to be much more citizen-centric.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021, we formed ServiceSG to create a single touchpoint for citizens
to access multiple services across agencies. In the digital sphere, we
have made great strides in making services more intuitive, seamless and
relevant for citizens, and we will continue to improve. For example, Singaporeans
can use SupportGoWhere, a one-stop portal to find Government support schemes
and services. A key feature is the Care Services Recommender for caregivers
to find the support they need easily and conveniently. Another example
is the MyLegacy@LifeSG portal which helps citizens plan ahead for end-of-life
matters.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even as more services are digitalised, the Public Service is committed
to ensuring that our services continue to be accessible and inclusive for
all. Today, citizens can walk into the seven physical ServiceSG centres
across Singapore and access<strong> </strong>close to 600 services and
schemes from over 25 agencies. Seniors who have difficulty making online
transactions can simply walk in. Officers are cross-trained to help them
access frequently used digital services, and 70 per cent of citizens visiting
ServiceSG Centres in 2023 were aged 55 and above.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will continue to expand the network of ServiceSG Centres to prioritise
areas with higher demand and concentration of citizens, particularly seniors,
who require support with multiple digital transactions. Aligned with this,
two new centres will be established at Woodlands Civic Centre and Bukit
Merah Central by the end of 2024.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are whole-of-government service standards to ensure agencies uphold
a consistent and satisfactory level of service. To avoid cases falling
through the cracks, we have a No Wrong Door policy for any public feedback
received. We will continue to ensure that our policies, standards and practices
are inclusive to all.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For municipal services, the Municipal Services Office, coordinates across
agencies and town councils to serve residents.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For businesses, MTI and GovTech are continuously evolving the GoBusiness
portal to facilitate a globally competitive, pro-enterprise operating environment
in Singapore. The GoBusiness portal allows businesses to access services
across multiple government agencies by milestone moments.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are just examples of how the Public Service is organising and evolving
to be much more mission-centric and much more citizen-centric.</p>

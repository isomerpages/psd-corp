##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on pay ratio disclosures for Ministries, Statutory Boards and Government-linked Companies

**Parliamentary Sitting: 4 Jul 2023**  
  
**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Prime Minister whether the Government is considering implementing pay ratio disclosures to require Ministries, statutory boards and Government companies to disclose the ratio of top to median, lower quartile and upper quartile staff pay ratios and if not, why not.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service:**  

1.             In October 2022, in response to a PQ from Mr Seah Kian Peng, I had explained why measuring pay ratios in the Public Service is not a meaningful endeavour.

2.             In the same month, I had also responded to a PQ from Mr Louis Chua to explain the measures and safeguards to ensure that Statutory Boards and Government companies put in place proper governance systems, are held accountable and continue to deliver services for the benefit of all Singaporeans.

3.             The considerations in those responses remain valid, and also apply to Ministries.

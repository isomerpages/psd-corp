##### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on ex-offenders hired in the Civil Service

**Parliamentary Sitting: 2 March 2017**  
  
**Mr Leon Perera**: To ask the Prime Minister how many ex-offenders have been hired by the civil service in each of the past five years and, by which ministries or statutory boards have they been hired.  
  
**Oral Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister in charge of the Civil Service:**

The Public Service does not track the number of ex-offenders employed.  Since 2006, applicants who have had their criminal records spent need not include this information in their application.  Recruitment is based on individual merits, where applicants who fit the job requirements most closely are hired.    
  
Applicants who are ex-offenders can be appointed, with due regard given to the seriousness and circumstances of the offence, the time that has elapsed since their conviction, and the duties and responsibilities to be assumed.  For example, we will understandably be more cautious in hiring ex-offenders for positions where an officer has authority over children.

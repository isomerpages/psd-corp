##### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on pensions for former Cabinet ministers

**Parliamentary Sitting Date: 21 April 2008**

Mr Seah Kian Peng: To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is the current monthly pension paid out to former Deputy Prime Ministers Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye and other first-generation Cabinet Ministers; and (b) whether there is a formula for revision of these payments to keep pace with inflation.

**Oral Reply by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong**

Pensions paid to office-holders, including first-generation Cabinet Ministers, are computed in accordance with the Parliamentary Pensions Act.  The pension amount is based on the years of service as an office-holder and the pensionable component of the salary for the office held. The pension is not subject to change.  

Recently, in May 2007, in recognition of the contributions made by the first-generation of leaders who served during the early years of nation-building, Government made special ex-gratia payments to former office-holders and MPs who were elected between 1959 and 1980 and retired before 31 Dec 1992 and are drawing a pension.  Similar ex-gratia payments were made to this group of pensioners previously, in 1996 and 2000.

Pensions are not indexed to inflation.

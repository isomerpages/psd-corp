<p><strong>Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on public disclosure of assets for Political Office Holders and key personnel in the Civil Service and Government-linked corporations&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 26 Feb 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister whether he
will consider the introduction of public disclosure of assets for (i) political
office holders and (ii) key personnel in the Civil Service and Government-linked
corporations to boost transparency and public trust.</p>
<p><strong>Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>

<p>&nbsp;There are already established processes in place for Political Office
Holders (POHs) and civil servants to make declarations of their assets.
The Code of Conduct for Ministers requires POHs to make a declaration of
their sources of income, assets, and financial liabilities to the President
through the Prime Minister, upon their appointment to office. Civil servants
make declarations of interests in investments and properties to their Head
of Agency annually and when they come to acquire significant assets. For
Government-linked companies, they are private entities and make their own
decisions on such matters.</p>

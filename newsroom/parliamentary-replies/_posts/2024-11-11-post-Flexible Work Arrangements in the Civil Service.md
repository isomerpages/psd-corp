<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 11 Nov 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister
and Minister for Finance in view of more large companies in the private
sector requiring employees to return to work in the office five days a
week (a) whether the Civil Service will continue to support flexible working
arrangements; and (b) whether the Government has conducted any studies
on the benefits of working from home on businesses such as environmental
impact from lesser commuting and financial impact from lower operating
and rental cost.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The Government recognises that there is a growing need for flexible work
arrangements (FWA), given the demographic changes facing Singapore and
the evolving demands on Singaporeans with an ageing society. As highlighted
in the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests (TG-FWAR),
FWAs are increasingly important in supporting working caregivers, encouraging
workforce re-entry, sustaining labour force participation, and enhancing
talent attraction and retention. Flexible work also presents other benefits
such as to the environment from reduced commute.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public
Service is committed to implementing FWAs to support the evolving needs
of our workforce. By the end of this year, Public Service agencies will
have in place procedures relating to reviewing formal FWA requests in line
with the TG-FWAR.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction
of FWAs in the Public Service has at the same time not seen us shy away
from our commitment to deliver effective policies and services. The recently
released Singapore Public Service Outcomes Review 2024 shows there has
been good progress in key areas such as growing opportunities for all,
strengthening the economy, ensuring high-quality and sustainable living
environment, and safety and security. We will continue to monitor the implementation
of FWAs within the Public Service moving forward and adjust our approach,
where necessary.</p>

##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Hiring for PMET-Level Job Vacancies in the Public Sector  

**Parliamentary Sitting: 4 January 2021**  
  
**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Prime Minister in each year of the past three years (a) how many PMET-level job vacancies in the public sector were filled; (b) how many of these are filled by mid-career hires from the private sector; and (c) of these mid-career external hires, what proportion has no prior public sector experience.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade & Industry and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service.**  
  
Some 2,500, 2,600, and 3,200 PMET vacancies in the Civil Service were filled each year in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to-date1 respectively. Of these placements, there has been an increase in the proportion of mid-career hires from the private sector from 27% in 2018 to 39% in 2020. Of these mid-career hires from the private sector, the proportion of hires who did not have prior public sector experience also increased from 48% in 2018 to 68% in 2020.

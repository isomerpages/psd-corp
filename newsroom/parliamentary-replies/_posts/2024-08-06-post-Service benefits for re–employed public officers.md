<p><strong>Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on service benefits for re-employed public officers</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Parliament Sitting: 3 Jul 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Lim: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister
for Finance for public sector employees that have reached the prevailing
Minimum Retirement Age, and have been re-employed by the Public Service,
whether their full tenure will be considered for long service benefits,
as provided for in clause 29 of the Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment
of Older Employees.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Oral Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Service Re-employment
Guidelines are aligned to the Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment
of Older Employees.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Public Service, re-employed
officers generally enjoy the same benefits as pre-retirement officers.
Key benefits, such as medical and dental treatment benefits, are not differentiated
by years in service. Re-employed officers will have their past years of
service considered for their vacation leave entitlement, and are eligible
for the Special Appreciation Award which recognises their continuous service
in re-employment, in lieu of the Long Service Award.</p>

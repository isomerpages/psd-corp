##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Civil Service re-employment guidelines for retirees

**Parliamentary Sitting: 17 August 2015**  
  
**Ms Chia Yong Yong**: To ask the Prime Minister (a) what are the Civil Service guidelines in determining when retirees should be employed and when they should be engaged as independent contractors for services; and (b) whether retirees should be employed on a part-time basis to enjoy employment benefits instead of being engaged as independent contractors.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

The Civil Service re-employment guidelines take reference from the Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees. Our agencies offer re-employment to all officers who wish to continue working, so long as they meet the minimum performance and conduct criteria and are medically fit to continue working up to age 67. The guidelines also provide for agencies to have early discussions with retiring officers on their re-employment plans, including the flexibility to opt for part time work arrangements.  
  
From 1 July 2011, when we introduced re-employment, to 31 December 2014, 98% of re-employed officers opted for full-time work arrangements, while 2% of re-employed officers opted for part-time work arrangements. Only one officer was re-employed on contract for service.

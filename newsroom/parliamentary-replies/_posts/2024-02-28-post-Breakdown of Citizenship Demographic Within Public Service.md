</p>
<p><strong>Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on breakdown of citizenship demographic within Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 28 Feb 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai:â€¯</strong>To ask the Prime Minister (a) within
the Public Service, what is the current number of (i) Singapore permanent
residents and (ii) foreigners employed; and (b) where are non-citizen officers
employed in the Public Service.</p>
<p><strong>Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 144,000 Singapore citizens, 5,000 Singapore
permanent residents and 3,000 foreigners employed in the Public Service.
Non-citizen officers generally serve in positions that require skills that
are in shortage among our local workforce, such as engineering and information
technology; and where the security concerns can be managed adequately.</p>

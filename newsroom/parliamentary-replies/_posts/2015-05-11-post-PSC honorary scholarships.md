##### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on PSC honorary scholarships

**Parliamentary Sitting: 11 May 2015**  
  
**Prof Tan Tai Yong**: To ask the Prime Minister (a) to date, how many honorary scholarships (scholarships with no funding) has the Public Service Commission given out; (b) when was the last occurence and what was this scholarship given out for; and (c) what are the reasons for this class of scholarships and whether these reasons can apply to a wider range of students.  
  
**Oral Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

The PSC does not currently award honorary or otherwise called nominal scholarships with no funding. Between 1968 and 1992, the PSC awarded nominal scholarships to 10 Presidentâ€™s Scholarship recipients. These scholarships did not come with funding, and had no bond. They recognised individuals who wanted to pursue courses overseas which the PSC had decided not fund.  
  
Currently, PSC scholarships are awarded to outstanding men and women with the passion, capability and clear commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans through a career in the Public Service. Hence, today, all individuals awarded PSC scholarships are provided full funding for their university studies and are expected to commit to work in the Public Service. Under this framework, the PSC thus no longer awards nominal scholarships.

##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the compensation for degree and non-degree holders 
  
**Parliamentary Sitting: 11 July 2018** 
  
**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Prime Minister whether the Civil Service pays non-degree holders the same compensation as degree holders for doing the same work, assuming all other factors being equal between the two types of employee.  

**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade & Industry and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service.** 
  
Officers in the Civil Service are paid salaries that are pegged to market benchmarks and practices, taking into consideration their job roles and responsibilities.

Within a job, the specific pay of officers would differ given differences in factors such as experience, skills and performance on the job. For candidates with no work experience at the point of recruitment, their starting salaries may be differentiated by qualification given that it is useful as a proxy for depth of knowledge and skill. However, once the officer is in service, his progression depends on his performance and potential and is independent of starting qualifications.

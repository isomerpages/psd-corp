##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on statistical changes in Current Estimated Potential (CEP) in the Civil Service

**Parliamentary Sitting: 14 October 2020**  
  
**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile change in a public officer's Current Estimated Potential (CEP) within five years of joining the public service; and (b) whether the Ministry will start collecting this data if it is not available.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade & Industry and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service.**  
  
Currently Estimated Potential (CEP) is expressed as the largest job size an officer is assessed to be capable of handling in future. This assessment is expected to change from time to time as officers develop in their job roles and display more of their competencies and capabilities. We understand that the Member is asking for the number of CEP grade changes that officers with CEPs at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles in the initial year will have, over the first five years of their careers.    
   
The large majority of officers, including those at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, will see potential fluctuations upwards and downwards in their CEP of between 1 and 5 grades during the first five years, as they adapt to the public service work and have opportunities to demonstrate their capabilities.

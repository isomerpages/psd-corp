1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations, interdiction is not meant to be a disciplinary penalty in and of itself. In the Civil Service, when officers have to be interdicted from duty while undergoing investigations, they are put on half-pay, subject to a floor of $1,200 and a ceiling of $8,500 per month.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers can be interdicted on no-pay from the point wrongdoing has been established by the relevant authorities, up to the conclusion of internal civil service disciplinary proceedings which may result in dismissal of the officers. Officers who have previously been interdicted on half-pay during investigations may also subsequently be put on no-pay interdiction after wrongdoing has been established by the relevant authorities. For instance, for cases involving police and CPIB investigations, officers interdicted on half-pay initially will be interdicted on no-pay if the Court convicts them of the charges.<br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on available interdiction records, about 300 civil servants were interdicted from duty over the last ten years since 2013. Of which, 10% were interdicted directly on no-pay as wrongdoing had been established at the point of interdiction. Around 30% were interdicted on half-pay initially and subsequently interdicted on no-pay. The remaining 60% have only half-pay interdiction records for various reasons such as ongoing internal investigations, pending court cases, no wrongdoing established, and resignation.<br>

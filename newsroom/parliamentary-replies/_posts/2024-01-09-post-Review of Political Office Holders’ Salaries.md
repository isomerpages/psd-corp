**Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on review of political office holders’ salaries**

**Parliament Sitting: 9 Jan 2024**

**Ms Hazel Poa:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether the targeted review of political appointment holders’ salaries in 2023 was carried out; (b) if so, who are the members of the Committee conducting the review; (c) what are the terms of reference given to the Committee; and (d) when will the Committee’s report be released.

**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service**

Mr Speaker, as Member Mr Alex Yam had earlier filed a similar Parliamentary Question for Written Answer, our response to the two PQs are similar. 

The recommendations from the last political salaries review were announced in 2018. The salary review Committee recommended a review of the political salaries framework about every five years, or when necessary. The Government did not make any changes to political salaries following the 2018 review as the salary structure remained valid and there were economic uncertainties in the previous few years.

A review of the political salaries was due in 2023. However, the government decided to defer the review as we have other pressing issues to deal with. In 2023, the global geopolitical situation has become more uncertain, with conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and continuing heightened geopolitical contestation. On the economic front, significant uncertainties and downside risks in the global economy remain, impacting our local economy and our wage and inflation outlooks. Hence, we decided to focus on dealing with these key challenges at hand and defer the review of political salaries for now.

The Government will review the political salaries framework and benchmark in due course to ensure that they remain relevant and up to date.

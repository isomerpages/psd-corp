<p><strong>Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Permanent Secretaries’ membership on boards of companies</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 9 Sep 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister
for Finance (a) what specific criteria and checks are used to determine
and monitor a Permanent Secretary's eligibility to sit on a company board;
(b) who is responsible for making, reviewing, and reassessing these appointments;
(c) how frequent are the appointments re-evaluated for potential conflicts
of interest; (d) in the past five years, how many times have these checks
identified and prevented a potential conflict; and (e) whether the results
of these checks are made public and, if not, why not.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Oral Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having public officers on private sector
boards, and likewise private sector individuals on public sector boards,
encourages greater diversity in perspectives and helps strengthen the understanding
between the public and private sectors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have explained in the written reply
to Ms Sylvia Lim on the same topic on 6 August 2024, Permanent Secretaries,
like all civil servants, are required to seek the necessary approvals prior
to accepting requests to serve as board directors of private sector companies.
The Public Service Division works with Ministries to conduct conflict of
interest checks to ensure that there is no conflict of interest, and that
the Permanent Secretaries’ ability to carry out their primary duties are
not compromised.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These checks take place prior to an
appointment to a company board, during re-appointments, or when there are
changes to an officer’s primary role. Appointments can proceed if there
is no conflict of interest.</p>

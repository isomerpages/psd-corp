##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Permanent Residents and foreigners employed in the Civil Service

**Parliamentary Sitting : 13 August 2012**

Mr Zainal Sapari: To ask the Prime Minister in the Civil Service (a) what is the number of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) currently employed; (b) what is the number of foreigners currently employed; (c) which are the sectors they are working in; and (d) whether Singapore Citizens are given priority over PRs when applying for such jobs.

**Written Reply (for the Prime Minister) by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

As at 31 December 2011, there were 3,071 Singapore Permanent Residents and 777 foreigners employed in the Civil Service.  They represented 4% and 1% of the Civil Service respectively.  The majority of the non-citizen officers were language teachers in the Education Service.

Recruitment is based on individual merit, through fair and open competition.  The vast majority of civil servants are Singapore citizens. Non-citizens are generally considered for positions that require skills that are in shortage among our workforce.

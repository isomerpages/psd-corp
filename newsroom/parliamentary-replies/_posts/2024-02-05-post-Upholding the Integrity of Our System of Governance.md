<p><strong>Oral Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service to Parliamentary Questions on upholding the integrity of our system of governance <br><br>Parliament Sitting: 5 February 2024</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mr Speaker, Sir. In view of Mr S Iswaran’s case, some members of the public
and various members in this House (Mr Edward Chia, Mr Derrick Goh, Ms Joan
Pereira, Mr Darryl David and Mr Mohd Fahmi) have asked about our rules
- whether they are adequate and should they be reviewed. May I have your
permission to answer Parliamentary Questions 28 to 31 on today’s Order
Paper? Mr Speaker, my response will also cover the matter raised in the
questions by Mr Darryl David and Mr Mohd Fahmi which are scheduled for
a subsequent sitting. I would invite Members to seek clarifications, if
need be. If the questions have been addressed, it may not be necessary
for members to proceed with the Parliamentary Questions for future sittings.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me first lay out our approach to uphold the integrity of our system
of governance so as to maintain public confidence and trust.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our rules are meant to facilitate our work and keep our officers safe
from being compromised. They should not be so onerous that our officers
cannot operate. Neither should they be so lax as to erode discipline and
trust in our system. When an incident happens, we should not have a knee
jerk reaction and immediately tighten or add more rules. Instead, we should
ask ourselves three questions:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, was it a case where the rules were clear,
but were flouted or ignored? If so, then what we need to do is not to adjust
the rules, but to take action against the offender.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, was it a case where the rules were unclear?
If so, then we should clarify or simplify the rules. But we should be mindful
that not every grey area can be clarified, and for some matters, judgement
will still be required. Our officers should not just understand the letter
of the rule, but also the spirit.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, was it a case where the rules were too lax,
or was it a new situation not envisaged or covered by the rules? If so,
we should update the rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To know which of these apply to the case of former Minister Iswaran, we
need to know the facts of the case, and we should not prejudge these facts
before the court trial.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining the integrity of our system is a multi-pronged and continuous
effort.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the individual level, we must have the right ethos
and values; understand both the spirit and letter of the rules; and uphold
them.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the team or organisation-level, we must look out
for one another to minimise the chances of us being compromised, subverted,
or succumbing to human frailties.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the system level, we must have regular internal
audits, external audits, and have institutions like AGO and CPIB to respond
to issues not picked up by other layers of checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Speaker, Sir, while we endeavour to do our best and keep improving
at the system level, no system is ever perfect, and will be able to pick
up every wrongdoing at the first instance, as much as we may desire.</p>
</li>
</ol>

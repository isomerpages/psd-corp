<p><strong>Oral Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service to Parliamentary Questions on upholding the integrity of our system of governance</strong>
<br><strong><br>Parliament Sitting: 5 February 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker,
Sir. In view of Mr S Iswaran’s case, some members of the public and various
members in this House (Mr Edward Chia, Mr Derrick Goh, Ms Joan Pereira,
Mr Darryl David and Mr Mohd Fahmi) have asked about our rules - whether
they are adequate and should they be reviewed. May I have your permission
to answer Parliamentary Questions 28 to 31 on today’s Order Paper? Mr Speaker,
my response will also cover the matter raised in the questions by Mr Darryl
David and Mr Mohd Fahmi which are scheduled for a subsequent sitting. I
would invite Members to seek clarifications, if need be. If the questions
have been addressed, it may not be necessary for members to proceed with
the Parliamentary Questions for future sittings.</p>

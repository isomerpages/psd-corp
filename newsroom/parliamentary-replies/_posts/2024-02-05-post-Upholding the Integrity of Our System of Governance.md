questions by Mr Darryl David and Mr Mohd Fahmi which are scheduled for
a subsequent sitting. I would invite Members to seek clarifications, if

Neither should they be so lax as to erode discipline and trust in our system.
When an incident happens, we should not have a knee jerk reaction and immediately
tighten or add more rules. Instead, we should ask ourselves three questions:</p>

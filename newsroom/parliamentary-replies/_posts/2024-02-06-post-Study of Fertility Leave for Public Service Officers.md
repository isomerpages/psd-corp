<p><strong>Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on study of fertility leave for public service officers</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 6 Feb 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister (a)
whether an update can be provided on the study of fertility leave for public
servants; and (b) if such a study has not been conducted, whether the Government
will study this proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p>We have assessed that there is no need to introduce fertility leave as
a separate leave provision at this juncture. Public officers who are undergoing
fertility-related procedures can already tap on their current leave provisions,
such as outpatient sick leave or hospitalisation leave, or request for
flexible work arrangements from their supervisors, such as flexi-time and
hybrid work arrangements to undergo or recuperate from the treatment.</p>

<li>
<p>In building a dynamic, efficient and resilient Public Service, diversity
is an important enabler.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversity has many dimensions, and is not limited to gender, ethnicity
and background. It must also include the diversity of experiences of different
job functions within and beyond the public sector. In forming strong leadership
teams, we consider the performance, potential and competencies of the individual
team members, and how they complement one another.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Public Service, leadership roles are not confined to the Permanent
Secretaries.&nbsp; Working with the political leadership, the Public Service
senior leadership comprises Permanent Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries,
Chief Executives, the heads of Professional Services, in domains such as
education, healthcare, urban planning, communications, science and technology,
and the younger officers on the Public Service Leadership Programme.&nbsp;
At the wider level, we also have the Chairmen and Board members of our
Statutory Boards, as well as the members of our councils and advisory committees.
Diversity is achieved at the system-level, rather than in specific segments
of the leadership structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While desirable, it is not always possible to have every leadership segment
to be a microcosm of our society. When a particular leadership segment
is not representative of our wider societyâ€™s diversity, we establish structures
and processes to ensure that the necessary breadth and depth of perspectives
and interests are taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To achieve the desired diversity of perspectives, experiences and capabilities
in our leadership teams, we adopt a multipronged approach.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Recruitment</strong>
</p>
<ol start="6" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Firstly, the Public Service is making efforts to recruit a more diverse
range of candidates, including promising mid-career leaders outside the
public sector who have the heart to serve. We also work with self-help
community groups such as MENDAKI and SINDA on outreach programmes to share
more about Public Service career opportunities. Through these efforts,
we hope to bring in capable individuals from the minority groups to serve
in various parts of the Public Service, including in leadership roles.
At the scholarship stage, the Public Service Commission is mindful to seek
out and award scholarships to candidates from diverse backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deployment / Training / Exposure</strong>
</p>
<ol start="7" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For in-service officers, we have been expanding the opportunities to give
them a more rounded experience.&nbsp; For the younger officers on the Public
Service Leadership Programme, most are rotated to different roles in different
sectors in their initial years, so that they have exposure to policy, operations,
stakeholder engagement and international relations. As they progress in
their careers, officers on the leadership programmes from across the Ministries
and Statutory Boards also come together for milestone training programmes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond public sector postings, the Service has also been expanding the
opportunities for attachments in the private and people sectors, to help
our leaders appreciate ground realities, understand stakeholder perspectives
and build their networks beyond the public sector.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Structures and Processes</strong>
</p>
<ol start="9" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We have a system of Statutory Boards, advisory councils and committees,
where we harness the expertise and energies of many individuals in the
private and people sectors to contribute on a wide range of issues, from
governance to specialist skills to policy reviews.&nbsp; It is also a standard
procedure for Ministries and Statutory Boards to consult widely, actively
and systematically when enacting legislation or implementing a complex
policy.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not always possible to achieve the same representations in all segments
of our leadership system that mirror our society in all aspects.&nbsp;
Neither is that necessarily our end goal.&nbsp; Instead, diversity of representation
is but one of the many <u>input</u> indicators. Our desired and more important <u>outcome</u> indicator
is the robust decision-making and effective and efficient execution of
policies, programmes and public services, enriched by diverse perspectives
and capabilities, and supported by our system of processes, structures,
recruitment and deployments.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Public Service will continue to build the best possible leadership
team in service of Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>
</li>

##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on appeals for lower fines for regulatory offences on grounds of financial hardship

**Parliamentary Sitting: 4 Jul 2023**  
  
**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) in each of the past 10 years, what proportion of offenders who have been imposed fines for regulatory offences like parking violations have appealed for lower fines on grounds of financial hardship; (b) what proportion of such appeals have been successful; and (c) what proportion of offenders have not paid such fines on grounds of financial hardship.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service:**  

1.         Fines for regulatory offences, such as parking violations, are imposed as a deterrent when an individual acts in a manner which contravene existing regulations and impact public interest.

2.         Accordingly, any appeal against fines is considered judiciously. Agencies carefully consider every appeal, taking into consideration factors such as the nature and severity of the offence, size of the fine, the offender’s record, the offender’s means to make payment, amongst other factors.

3\.         We do not collect the data as requested by the Member. The proportions of fines waived by different agencies can vary significantly across offences, time, and circumstances.

4\.         Besides the lowering of fines, other options such as extending the deadline for payment of the fine or instalment plans are also possible options for those facing financial challenges.

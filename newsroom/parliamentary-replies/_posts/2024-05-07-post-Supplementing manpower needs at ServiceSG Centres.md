<p><strong>Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on supplementing manpower needs at ServiceSG Centres</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 7 May 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim</strong>: To ask the Prime Minister
what are the plans to supplement the manpower needs at existing ServiceSG
Centres through secondments from other Public Service divisions or general
recruitment.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<p>1. ServiceSG Centres currently provide over 500 services across over 20
agencies to citizens. ServiceSG adopts a few strategies to address the
demand for its services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. First, it seeks to pre-empt a spike in demand by taking measures to
proactively anticipate and address citizens’ needs, working closely with
agencies. For instance, during the annual tax filing this year, ServiceSG
supported IRAS to organise tax filing educational workshops for gig workers,
delivery workers, taxi and private hire car drivers. This helps to reduce
walk-in demands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Secondly, ServiceSG augments its workforce with volunteers. ServiceSG
has initiated a “Community Kaki” programme, where senior volunteers assist
with straightforward digital transactions and teach seniors how to transact
digitally. 26 Community Kakis are currently deployed across our centres
with highly positive feedback from residents. Volunteers from within the
Public Service are sometimes also recruited and deployed to assist with
peaks in demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Despite the high demand for its services, ServiceSG consistently achieves
high levels of satisfaction from citizens.&nbsp; ServiceSG will continue
to work across the Public Service to synchronise efforts and resources
to ensure ServiceSG Centres are adequately resourced to serve citizens
effectively.</p>

##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the number of Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarships that have been awarded to the Malay community

**Parliamentary Sitting: 21 October 2013**

Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap: To ask the Prime Minister (a) how many Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarships have been awarded to the Malay community annually in the past 10 years; (b) what is the breakdown of the various disciplines pursued; and (c) where have these scholars been deployed upon their graduation.  

**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

PSC scholarships are awarded on merit. We encourage outstanding students from all backgrounds with the passion and commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans to apply for a PSC scholarship. There is no quota on the number of scholarships to be awarded each year. All deserving candidates, regardless of their race and background, will be awarded a scholarship.

Between 2004 and 2013, six PSC scholarships were awarded to Malays. One was a President’s-cum-Singapore Police Force Overseas Scholarship (SPFOS) holder.

These scholarship recipients pursued a variety of disciplines such as Law, Economics, Biochemistry and Aeronautical Engineering at the undergraduate level.  Those who have graduated were deployed on their first posting to various agencies including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources and Ministry of Social and Family Development. Their deployment took into consideration their training and preferences, and the Public Service’s needs, no different from that of any other PSC scholarship holders.

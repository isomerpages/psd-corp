<p><strong>Ms Hazel Poa: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister (a) in 2023,

(c) how many officers have chosen to retain the gifts; (d) what is the
number of meal invitations declared to their Permanent Secretaries; and

<p>1. Civil servants and political officeholders must not ask for gifts or
favours, especially when they are in a position to influence or affect
any decision involving the other party. If it is not possible or it is
impractical to decline gifts or meals, officers should declare and account
for it according to established processes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. For gifts that are less than $50, the officer may be allowed to retain
the gift without payment after taking into account considerations such
as conflict of interest. For gifts that are $50 or more, an officer may
be allowed to retain the gift if he pays its value to the government. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. In 2023, there were about 3,450 gift declarations made by civil servants
and political officeholders. Of these, officers were allowed to retain
60%. About 14% of the declarations were for gifts valued $50 or more. We
do not collect data on meal invitations centrally.</p>

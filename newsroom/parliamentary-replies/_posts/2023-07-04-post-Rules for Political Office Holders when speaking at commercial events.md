##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on rules for Political Office Holders when speaking at commercial events

**Parliamentary Sitting: 4 Jul 2023**  
  
**Ms Sylvia Lim:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) what rules apply to Ministers and other political officeholders on whether to accept invitations to speak at events organised by commercial organisations; and (b) what are the enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure that political officeholders are not leveraged on to promote commercial interests.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service:**  

1.         From time to time, Ministers and other political office holders receive invitations from private and people sector organisations to grace their events and deliver speeches. In deciding whether to accept the invitations, the office holders take into account whether the nature of the events or potential speech content advance the policy objectives of their respective ministries or are aligned with government priorities.

2.         They will ensure that their attendance and speech at these events will not be perceived as endorsing the commercial interests of the organisations.

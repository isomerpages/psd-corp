<p><strong>Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on plans to set up more ServiceSG centres across Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 29 Feb 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister whether the
Public Service Division can share what are the plans (i) to set up more
ServiceSG centres across Singapore and to involve more partnering agencies
in the initiative and (ii) to require that at the same time for Ministries
and agencies to set aside physical counters for seniors requiring assistance
to access public services.</p>
<p><strong>Oral Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>

<li>
<p>The Public Service is committed to ensuring that Government services continue
to be accessible and inclusive for all as more Government services digitalise.
We have put in place schemes and initiatives to bridge the digital divide,
by enabling digital access and accessibility, and upskilling citizens on
digital skills and knowledge.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We have significantly expanded the number of ServiceSG Centres to better
serve the community. Since its inception in 2021, ServiceSG has set up
7 centres. These centres are located at Our Tampines Hub, One Punggol,
Bukit Canberra, Kampong Chai Chee Community Club, Nee Soon Central Community
Club, The Frontier Community Club, and Keat Hong Community Club. The ServiceSG
Centres have also expanded their service offerings in partnership with
more than 25 agencies, providing almost 600 services to citizens.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We will continue to expand the network of centres to prioritise areas
with higher demand and concentration of citizens, particularly seniors,
who require support with multiple digital transactions. In line with this,
two new centres will be established at Woodlands Civic Centre and Bukit
Merah town central by the end of 2024.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Presently, all our agencies with physical service centres primarily offer
in-person assistance on an appointment-only basis. This approach allows
citizens to schedule visits at their convenience for transactions that
cannot be completed online, thereby reducing the frustration of long queues
or wait times. While agencies encourage citizens to make appointments for
face-to-face consultations, they do exercise discretion in assisting less
digitally savvy and vulnerable individuals who walk in without making appointments.
Trained service ambassadors are also present at these service centres to
assist less digitally literate individuals in triaging their needs and
completing their transactions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Seniors can also walk into ServiceSG Centres and no prior appointment
is needed.</p>

<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 18 Feb 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister and
Minister for Finance whether a ServiceSG Centre will be established in
Serangoon Town Centre to serve residents requiring in-person assistance
for e-Government services, given that the nearest centres are at One Punggol,
Our Tampines Hub and Nee Soon Central; and (b) if not, why not.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Public Service is committed to ensure that government services are
accessible and inclusive. As we digitalise government services to make
them more convenient for citizens to access, we are also making efforts
to close the digital divide. This includes initiatives to enable digital
access and help citizens learn new digital skills to transact with the
government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also started ServiceSG Centres to support citizens who need help
with government e-services. Since 2021, we have expanded the ServiceSG
Centre network to nine centres islandwide, including two new centres that
opened in October 2024 at Woodlands and Bukit Merah. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no plan in the short term to start a ServiceSG Centre in Serangoon
town. However, we will continue to plan and expand the network of centres
taking into consideration factors such as the level of needs in a locality,
opportunities for integration of various existing government agency shopfronts
within a locality for greater service delivery effectiveness, the availability
of resources and the availability of suitable sites.</p>

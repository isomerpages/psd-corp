</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>*6228. Mr Leong Mun Wai: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister and
Minister for Finance (a) whether the Chief Justice and the Minister for
Law have a role under the framework of the Judgesâ€™ Remuneration Act 1994
to determine the fixed and variable components of salaries paid to the
Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal and other Judges of the Supreme Court;
and (b) if so, what is the extent of the role played by the Chief Justice
and the Minister for Law respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>*6246. Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: To ask the Prime Minister and
Minister for Finance for each year since 2010, what is the average and
median of (i) total salary package and (ii) each of the following six components:
gross annual salary, annual variable component, non-pensionable annual
allowance, performance bonus, national bonus and judiciary allowance, paid
to the Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and other Judges of the Supreme
Court respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Judges Remuneration Act 1994 falls
under the responsibility of the Minister-in-charge of the Public Service
and not the Minister for Law. It sets out the framework for the salaries,
allowances and privileges accorded to Supreme Court Judges as a class.
The Chief Justice determines the salary and bonuses to be paid to each
Supreme Court Judge within this framework. Neither the Minister-in-charge
of the Public Service nor any Minister determines the payment to be made
to specific judges.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The salaries of Judicial Appointment
Holders take reference from a number of salary data sources, including
market surveys by compensation specialists. This is similar to how the
salaries of other public officers are determined, based on the size of
the job and benchmarking with relevant talent pools in the private sector,
to ensure that the Public Service is able to attract and retain our fair
share of talent.</p>

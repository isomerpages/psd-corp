<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 4 Feb 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim: To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for
Finance with regard to the various scholarship schemes offered by Government
agencies over the past decade (a) how many scholarship recipients terminated
their bonds during their course of study; and (b) how many scholarship
recipients terminated their bonds during their period of service.</p>
<p><strong>Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p>Between 2014 and 2023, Ministries and Statutory Boards collectively awarded
4,500 scholarships or an average of 450 scholarships per year. However,
the total number of scholarship recipients in the system at any one time
is significantly larger because each scholarship recipient takes about
four years to complete their studies, and then works in the Public Service
to serve out their bond and beyond.</p>
<p>The proportion of bond-breakers is low. Each year on average over the
last 10 years, 10 scholarship recipients broke their bond during their
studies and 14 resigned before serving out the full length of their bond.
Scholarship recipients who do not serve out their bonds are required to
repay the value of their scholarship, taking into account the number of
years they have served.</p>

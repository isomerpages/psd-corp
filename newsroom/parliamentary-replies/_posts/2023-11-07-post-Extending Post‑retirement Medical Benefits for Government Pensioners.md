<b>Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on extending post-retirement medical benefits for Government pensioners</b><br>

<b>Parliament Sitting: 7 Nov 2023</b><br>

<b>Mr Murali Pillai:</b>&nbsp;To ask the Prime Minister whether post-retirement medical benefits for Government pensioners can be extended to cover all in-patient treatments received at community hospitals, nursing homes and hospices, including palliative care, without referrals from the restructured hospitals.<br>

<b>Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</b><br>

The post-retirement medical benefits for Government pensioners have been designed to cover direct reimbursement for acute care in restructured hospitals and post discharge sub-acute and rehabilitative care in community hospitals, in accordance with the pensioner’s medical benefits scheme and subject to prevailing guidelines. The post-retirement medical benefits for Government pensioners also include provision for MediShield Life premiums or additional MediSave contributions. Most pensioners are also eligible for support under the Pioneer or Merdeka Generation Packages, which include lifelong MediSave top-ups from the Government. Through the coverage provided for by MediShield Life and MediSave, pensioners can receive support for inpatient treatments in community hospitals, nursing homes and hospices, without referrals from restructured hospitals.<br>

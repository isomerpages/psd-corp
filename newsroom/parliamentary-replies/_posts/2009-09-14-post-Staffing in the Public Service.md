##### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on staffing in the Public Service

**Parliamentary Sitting Date: 14 September 2009**

Ms Ellen Lee Geck Hoon: To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is being done to ensure sufficient staffing and spread of duties in Public Service departments, including statutory boards and restructured hospitals, that have a high concentration of female employees in order to address staff shortages when these females go on 16-week maternity leave, whether taken all at once or in tranches; and (b) how will the Government recognise the contribution of staff who help to cover the duties of these female employees since by doing so they are also contributing to Government’s efforts to promote/encourage procreation.

**Oral Reply (for the Prime Minister) by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister in charge of the Civil Service, and Minister for Defence:**

Public sector agencies, like any organisation, would need to actively manage staffing issues when their officers are away for long periods of time.  This involves early planning and discussions between the officer and the organisation so that the organisation has sufficient time to make alternative staffing arrangements.

These arrangements would vary, depending on each agency.  It could include employing temporary staff or having other officers cover the duties of the officer who is away.

Let me share what the Ministry of Education does.  MOE has a large proportion of teachers who are female.  To help schools manage their staffing needs, MOE provides additional teacher headcounts as well as manpower grants for schools to purchase additional manpower services where necessary.  This ensures that there are no disruptions when teachers need to be away from work, whether for maternity leave or other reasons, such as training or professional development leave.   Schools would also tap on their pool of experienced Adjunct Teachers (who were former teachers or retired teachers) to fill in when teachers need to be away.

Public sector agencies would know in advance when an officer is to go on maternity leave and would therefore have sufficient time to make the necessary prior arrangements.  Subject to mutual agreement between the officer and the agency, the maternity leave framework also allows the flexibility to spread out the last 8 weeks of the 16-week maternity leave, to be taken over a period of 12 months.  This can also be taken on a part-time basis.

On the issue of recognition for officers who have to cover duties for their colleagues, all contributions made by an officer during the year are taken into account during the year-end performance appraisal exercise.  Officers who have performed well above the requirements of their grade would be recognised and rewarded through the Performance Bonus framework.

**Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan:** To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Public Service Division will consider allowing retired civil servants to continue accessing their Learn.gov.sg accounts in the spirit of lifelong learning and continuing education.


**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service**


The LEARN platform is designed to serve the learning and development needs of in-service public officers, and the courses address specific job requirements. Retired civil servants who are re-employed by the Civil Service will have access to LEARN. Other retirees can continue to be lifelong learners by accessing SkillsFuture courses and other programmes available nationally, such as through the National Silver Academy and Institutes of Higher Learning.

##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on applications for Public Service Commission scholarships from junior college students

**Parliamentary Sitting: 4 Jul 2023**  
  
**Mr Leong Mun Wai:**&nbsp;To ask the Prime Minister for each year since 2008, how many applications for Public Service Commission scholarships have been received from junior college students, with a breakdown by junior colleges.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service:**  

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Service Commission (PSC) receives scholarship applications from students of all junior colleges (JCs) including the Specialised Schools [\[1\]](#_ftn1). The&nbsp; &nbsp;proportion of each JC cohort who apply for the PSC Scholarships has been stable over the past 15 years at 10-13%. &nbsp;

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our JCs offer a range of programmes, including the A-level programme, the International Baccalaureate and specialised programmes. They take in students with different abilities and interests. The number of JCs, the programmes they offer, and their respective intakes have also changed over the years.&nbsp; Hence, it is not meaningful to compare application numbers across the JCs and over the years. Notwithstanding, the PSC works closely with all JCs to actively encourage suitable candidates to apply and support them through career guidance initiatives.

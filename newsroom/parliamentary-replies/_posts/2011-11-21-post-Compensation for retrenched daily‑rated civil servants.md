##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on compensation for retrenched daily-rated civil servants

**Parliamentary Sitting: 21 November 2011**

Mr Yaw Shin Leong: To ask the Prime Minister in respect of Division 4 and daily-rated civil servants in the Civil Service, what is (i) the number of such workers who were retrenched from 2006 to 2010; (ii) the percentage of these workers who received compensation for retrenchment; (iii) the average number of months of salary paid as compensation; and (iv) the number of such workers who were upskilled to Division 3, from 2006 to 2010.

**Written Reply (for the Prime Minister) by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

The Civil Service’s Special Resignation Scheme (SRS) allows civil servants whose jobs are no longer needed and who cannot be deployed to other jobs within the Civil Service to leave with compensation.

From 2006 to 2010, 20 Division IV officers left the Civil Service through the SRS. All received compensation generally calculated at one month’s last drawn salary for each year of service and capped at 25 years.

72 Division IV officers were promoted to Division III jobs in the same period.

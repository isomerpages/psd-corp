<p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan</strong>: To ask the Prime Minister in
view of rising healthcare costs, when will be the next review on the maximum
reimbursement of outpatient medical and dental expenses for civil servants
since the last adjustments were made about a decade ago.</p>

<p>1. The Member may refer to the PQs answered on 22 Nov 2023 and 6 Feb 2024
pertaining to reviews on benefits for public officers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. There is no fixed schedule for the review of medical and dental benefits.
The Government continually considers the adequacy of our overall compensation
and benefits package, taking into account factors such as the cost of healthcare,
fiscal prudence, as well as other national policies.</p>

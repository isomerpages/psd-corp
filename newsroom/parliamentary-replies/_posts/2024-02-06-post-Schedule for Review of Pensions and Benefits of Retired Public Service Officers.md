<p><strong>Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on schedule for review of pensions and benefits of retired public service officers</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 6 Feb 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Darryl David: </strong>To ask the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Finance (a) whether there is a regular schedule for the review
of pensions and benefits of retired public service officers; and (b) if
so, how often are such reviews scheduled for.</p>
<p><strong>Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>

<p>The Member may refer to the PQ answered on 20 Oct 2022 titled ‘Review
of Payouts to Retirees on Government Pension Schemes Given Rising Cost
of Living’.</p>
<p>There is no fixed schedule for reviews. The Government continually considers
the adequacy of its benefits provisions, taking into factors such as inflation,
fiscal cost as well as other national policies. For example, Government
pensioners also benefit from other forms of national support, including
the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation packages, GST vouchers, and Community
Development Council vouchers.</p>

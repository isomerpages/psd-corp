<p><strong>Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Permanent Secretaries appointed to private sector boards</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 6 Aug 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister
for Finance (a) how many Permanent Secretaries are currently appointed
to the boards of directors of private sector businesses; (b) which businesses
or business sectors currently have boards of directors that include a Permanent
Secretary; and (c) how are potential conflicts of interest managed in such
situations.</p>
<p></p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are currently 10 Permanent Secretaries
serving on the boards of private sector companies, in sectors such as finance,
utilities and maritime. Having public officers on private sector boards,
and likewise private sector individuals on public sector boards, encourages
greater diversity in perspectives and helps strengthen the understanding
between the public and private sectors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all civil servants, Permanent Secretaries
are required to seek the necessary approvals prior to accepting requests
to serve as board directors of private sector companies. There are checks
in place to ensure that there is no conflict of interest, and that their
ability to carry out their primary duties are not compromised.</p>

**Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on percentage of maximum reimbursement of dental expenses for public officers and quantum adjustment**

**Parliament Sitting: 22 Nov 2023**

**Mr Leong Mun Wai:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) for each year since 2010, what percentage of public officers have fully utilised the maximum reimbursement of dental expenses, which currently stands at $120 per year; and (b) whether the Government plans to adjust this quantum in line with the rising cost of healthcare and, if not, why.

**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service**

In the last 5 years, on average, less than 20% of officers in the Civil Service fully utilise their dental benefits of $120 per year. We regularly review compensation and benefits to ensure that the overall package remains suitable for our needs.

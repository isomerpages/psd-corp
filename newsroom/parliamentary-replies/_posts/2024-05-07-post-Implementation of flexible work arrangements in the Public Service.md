<p>1. Prior to the release of the latest Tripartite Guidelines, flexible
work arrangements (FWAs) have already been made available to public officers.
These arrangements include staggered work hours, part-time work options
and telecommuting. Officers and their agencies may agree on the suitable
flexible work arrangements, taking into account the officers’ personal
needs and the agencies’ operational considerations. The Public Service
welcomes greater adoption of FWAs in the Public Service as we strive to
help public officers better balance work and personal responsibilities
(e.g., caregiving duties) while continuing to uphold our duties and service
to the public.</p>

##### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on the review of the diminished impact of the Pioneer Generation Package for low-income elderly pensioners

**Parliamentary Sitting: 9 September 2014**

Mr Seah Kian Peng: To ask the Prime Minister whether a review of the diminished impact of the Pioneer Generation Package for low-income elderly pensioners is being undertaken.

**Oral Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

Government pensioners will continue to receive all their post-retirement medical benefits that they are currently getting.

The Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) honours our Pioneer Generation (PG) by taking care of their healthcare needs. Government pensioners who are Pioneers will also enjoy these Pioneer Generation benefits. All Singaporeans who meet the PG criteria, including Government pensioners, will be eligible for lifelong Medisave top-ups, outpatient care subsidies, and MediShield Life premium subsidies under the PGP, regardless of their income.

While Government pensioners continue to enjoy their post-retirement medical benefits under their respective medical schemes, they will still benefit from the PGP. Like other Pioneers, they will receive lifelong annual Medisave top-ups of $200 to $800. In addition, they will enjoy enhanced Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) subsidies at participating General Practitioner and dental clinics. This will reduce their out-of-pocket expenses under their existing medical benefit schemes as pensioners. Pensioners who have moderate to severe functional disabilities will also receive $100 per month under the Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme.

MediShield Life is a compulsory scheme for all Singaporeans. Hence Government pensioners will also be enrolled in MediShield Life, and be able to enjoy the benefits of MediShield Life that are beyond the current post-retirement medical benefits that Government pensioners receive. Our Government pensioners will each receive a letter from the Public Service Division in October with details on how they are being assisted to enrol in MediShield Life.

Overall, the PGP, together with post-retirement medical benefits of Government pensioners, will ensure that Government pensioners who are Pioneers will be better off than before.

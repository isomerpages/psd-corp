**Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the applications for vocational and skills-based jobs in the Civil Service  
  
Parliamentary Sitting: 8 January 2018  
  
**Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap:** To ask the Prime Minister how and to what extent are O and A Level results considered in evaluating applications from older applicants for vocational and skills-based jobs in the Civil Service.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister in charge of the Civil Service.**  
  
The Civil Service recruits based on whether the applicant has the skills required for the job. Educational qualifications are useful as a proxy for skills when assessing applicants with no prior work experience. For mid-career and older applicants, relevant work experience and demonstrated skills are used to determine their suitability for the job, more so than their academic qualifications.

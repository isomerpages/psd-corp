##### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on causes for low take-up rates for childcare and paternity leave amongst eligible public officers

**Parliamentary Sitting: 9 September 2014**

Mr Seah Kian Peng: To ask the Prime Minister given that amongst all eligible public officers, only 72% used the 6-day childcare leave, 48% used the 2-day extended childcare leave and 78% used their paternity leave, what are the underlying causes for these relatively low take-up rates.

**Oral Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

The Public Service supports the well-being and work-life needs of our officers. On top of Vacation Leave, officers are provided with a range of pro-family leave benefits to help them balance their family and work commitments. These include childcare, paternity, maternity and parent-care leave. Officers utilise their leave benefits on a needs basis. Rather than focusing on the utilization rate for specific leave types, we will continue to ensure that pro-family leave benefits are made known and available to officers so that they can utilize them when they need to do so.

##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on re-employment offered to public service officers above 60 years old in past five and 10 years  

**Parliamentary Sitting: 14 September 2021**  
  
**Mr Abdul Samad:** To ask the Prime Minister with regard to older workers employed in the public service who are above 60 years old, how many have been offered re-employment (i) in the past five years and (ii) in the past 10 years.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service.**  
  
On 1 July 2011, the Public Service introduced re-employment of officers from the ages of 62 to 65, ahead of national legislation which took effect from 1 January 2012.  
  
Over the past ten years from 1 July 2011 to 31 December 2020, over 8 in 10 officers who retired at age 62 were re-employed.  
  
Over the past five years from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020, the re-employment rate was similar.

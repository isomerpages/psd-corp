##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on flexible work arrangements in the Public Service

**Parliamentary Sitting: 10 Oct 2016**  
  
**Mr Leon Perera**: To ask the Prime Minister (a) over the last five years, what is the number of civil servants engaged in (i) part-time work arrangements and (ii) job-sharing arrangements; and (b) how are Ministries and statutory boards ensuring more mothers and caregivers are provided with flexible work arrangements.   
  
**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service.**  
  
The number of public officers on part-time work arrangements increased from 1,415 in 2011 to 2,019 officers in 2015. We do not track the number of public officers who are job-sharing while on part-time work arrangements.  
  
The range of flexible work arrangements offered by our agencies includes staggered start-work hours, telecommuting and part-time work.  Public officers, including mothers and caregivers, may apply for such flexible work arrangements, where their job nature allows. Besides flexible work arrangements, we also support mothers and caregivers through various leave provisions, such as parent-care leave, childcare leave, maternity leave and paternity leave.

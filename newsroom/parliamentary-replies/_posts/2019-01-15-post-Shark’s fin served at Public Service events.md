#####  Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on shark’s fin served at Public Service events  
  
**Parliamentary Sitting: 15 January 2019**
  
**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether sharks fin is still being served at events organised by or for the public service; and (b) whether sharks fin will be served at future events organised by or for the public service.  
 
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade & Industry and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service.**
  
Public agencies abide by the procurement principles of fairness, transparency and value-for-money.  Agencies decide on their respective menus based on what is prudent and appropriate for the occasion.  We do not have policies specific to the serving of shark’s fin.

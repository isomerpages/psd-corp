<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Superscale officers generally hold senior management positions and form
around 2.5% of the Civil Service.&nbsp; Over the last five years, the annual
remuneration of MX 9 officers ranged from about $200,000 to $260,000, depending
on economic growth for the year and an officerâ€™s individual performance.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Salaries comprise both fixed and variable components, of which the latter
varies depending on economic conditions and individual performance. Together,
the variable components constituted around 20 - 35% of the total annual
remuneration at the MX 9 level in the last 5 years.</p>

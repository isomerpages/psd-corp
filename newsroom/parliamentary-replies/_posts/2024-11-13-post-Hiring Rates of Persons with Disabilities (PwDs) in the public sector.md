<p><strong>Parliament Sitting: 13 Nov 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam: </strong>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister
for Finance (a) what specific factors have contributed to the lower hiring
rate of Persons with disabilities (PWDs) in the public sector compared
to the private sector; (b) how the hiring rate of PWDs in Singapore’s public
service quantitatively compares with that in other developed countries;
(c) what structural or policy-related constraints prevent Singapore Government
agencies from increasing PWD hires; and (d) what steps are being taken
to address these constraints directly.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Oral Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is not meaningful to compare the hiring rate of persons with disabilities
in the public and private sectors as the contexts and nature of jobs in
the two sectors differ. The Government is focused on raising the overall
employment rate of persons with disabilities, across both the public and
private sectors, where persons with disabilities are placed and retained
in jobs that are best suited to their strengths and capabilities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the public sector also
has a significant proportion of roles for which a certain level of physical
and mental fitness is required, such as the uniformed services. This is
one reason why hiring rates of persons with disabilities may differ across
sectors. There is also no comparative data for the hiring rates of persons
with disabilities in the public sector across developed countries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Honourable Member also asked
about the constraints of hiring persons with disabilities and steps taken
to address these constraints. The Member may refer to the responses to
the PQ he raised on 15 October, and the PQ raised by Member Mr Don Wee
on 9 September, where we shared the public sector’s approach to the issue.</p>

<p>The public sector has been and will continue to support the employment
of persons with disabilities.</p>

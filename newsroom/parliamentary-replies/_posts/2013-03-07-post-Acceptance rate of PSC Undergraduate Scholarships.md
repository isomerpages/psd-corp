##### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Acceptance rate of PSC Undergraduate Scholarships

**Parliamentary Sitting: 7 March 2013**

Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene: To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is the acceptance rate for PSC undergraduate scholarships, overseas and local, for the last five years; and (b) what are the reasons for scholarship offerees declining the awards.

**Oral reply by (for the Prime Minister) Mr Teo Chee Hean Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

PSC scholarships are awarded to outstanding students with the passion and commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans through a career in the Civil Service.

Over the last five years, the average acceptance rate for PSC scholarships was about 80%. This covers both local and overseas scholarships awarded by the PSC at the undergraduate level. Generally, students who decline the PSC scholarship offers do so as they have scholarship offers from other public sector agencies to pursue more specialised careers, or are undecided about pursuing a Civil Service career.

This is consistent with the message that the PSC Secretariat has been actively sharing with students, parents and schools â€“ that the PSC scholarship is a gateway to a Civil Service career, and that students should think very carefully before applying for or accepting a PSC scholarship.

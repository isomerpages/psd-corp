<p>1. As at 31 Dec 2023, the breakdown of public officers in the Ministries
and Statutory Boards whose ages are (i) below 40 years old; (ii) 40 to
49 years old; (iii) 50 to 59 years old; (iv) 60 years old and above is
47%, 29%, 17%, and 7% respectively. The breakdown is largely similar across
both Ministries and Statutory Boards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The proportions of officers on part-time work arrangements and on contracts
of less than 1 year are around 1% respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. There are about 2,300 and 3,400 re-employed officers above 63 years
old respectively, and almost all are working full-time.</p>

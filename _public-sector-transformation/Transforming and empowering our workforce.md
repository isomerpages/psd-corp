<h3><strong>Transforming and empowering our workforce</strong></h3>
<p>Transformation is not just about processes and policies—it is also about
equipping public officers to be future-ready.</p>
<h4>Empowering competency-driven growth</h4>
<p>We have moved towards a Competency-Driven Growth framework, where we translate
evolving business needs into job competencies, and outline the competencies
officers need to develop to perform their functions well. This provides
a common language for public officers and Public Service leaders to discuss
the competencies that need to be built and exercised within each role.</p>
<h4>Deepening our perspectives of the world and strengthening linkages with partners</h4>
<p>To further our cause for Singapore to thrive, and for Singaporeans to
have opportunities to fulfil their potential and dreams, the Public Service
is sending more public officers beyond the Public Service and Singapore
to understand and build linkages with partners.</p>
<h4>Preparing officers for longer career spans</h4>
<p>We have introduced a Public Service Career Coach Network and will be ramping
up our CareerFitness programme to empower our officers to build career
resilience and agility across different life stages.</p>

<h4>Strengthening team development</h4>
<p>To prepare for a more complex and challenging operating environment, the
Public Service is strengthening the way we compose teams with diverse abilities,
backgrounds and perspectives. We will also develop stronger and more agile
leadership teams to bring out the best in our agencies, to enable Singapore
and Singaporeans’ success.</p>

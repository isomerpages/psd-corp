<h3><strong>Transforming our officers’ workplace experience</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A productive and supportive work environment is key to our success.</p>
<h4>Flexible work arrangements</h4>
<p>We enable offices to balance their work-life priorities with flexible
work arrangements. These include flexi-load (e.g. part-time), flexi-place
(e.g. telecommuting) and flexi-time (e.g. staggered hours), subject to
the operational requirements of the role and public agency.</p>
<h4>CoWork@Gov</h4>
<p>CoWork@Gov has enhanced the way public officers work by providing a network
of shared spaces across Singapore. These spaces offer officers flexibility
in their workday, whether they need a quiet spot to work between meetings,
a convenient location to catch up on tasks, or a collaborative environment
for cross-agency discussions. By making workspaces available at various
locations, CoWork@Gov supports a more mobile and connected public service,
helping officers make better use of their time while fostering opportunities
for collaboration across agencies.</p>
<h4>Public Service for Good</h4>
<p>Public Service for Good (PSFG) empowers public officers to make a meaningful
difference in society through skills-based volunteering. This purposeful
initiative enables officers to contribute their expertise across four key
areas: empowering those in need, supporting seniors to age well, investing
in sustainability, and building our home together with Singaporeans. Beyond
just volunteering, PSFG offers officers valuable opportunities to strengthen
their connection with citizens, deepen their understanding of ground realities,
and develop new capabilities while serving the community.</p>

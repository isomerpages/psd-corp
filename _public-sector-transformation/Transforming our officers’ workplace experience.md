<h3><strong>Transforming our officers’ workplace experience</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A productive and supportive work environment is key to our success. Besides
using technology and digital tools to improve our productivity, we also
support the well-being of public officers through fostering a culture of
care across the Public Service.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Flexible work arrangements</h4>
<p>We enable public officers to balance their work-life priorities with flexible
work arrangements. These include flexi-load (e.g. part-time), flexi-place
(e.g. telecommuting) and flexi-time (e.g. staggered hours), subject to
the operational requirements of the role and public agency.</p>
<h4>CoWork@Gov shared workspaces</h4>
<p>Public officers are able to work from a network of shared workspaces across
Singapore. These spaces offer officers flexibility in their workday, whether
they need a quiet spot to work between meetings, a convenient location
to catch up on tasks, or a collaborative environment for cross-agency discussions.
By making workspaces available at various locations, CoWork@Gov supports
a more mobile and connected Public Service, helping officers make better
use of their time while fostering opportunities for collaboration across
agencies.</p>
<h4>Public Service for Good</h4>
<p>The Public Service for Good movement empowers public officers to make
a meaningful difference in society through skills-based volunteering. This
purposeful initiative enables officers to contribute their expertise across
four key areas: empowering those in need, supporting seniors to age well,
investing in sustainability, and building our home together with Singaporeans.
Beyond just volunteering, PSFG offers officers valuable opportunities to
strengthen their connection with citizens, deepen their understanding of
ground realities, and develop new capabilities while serving the community.</p>

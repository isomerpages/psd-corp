<h3><strong>Transforming our officers’ workplace experience</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A productive and supportive work environment is key to our success. Besides
using technology and digital tools to improve our productivity, we also
support the well-being of public officers through fostering a culture of
care across the Public Service.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Flexible work arrangements</h4>
<p>We enable public officers to balance their work-life priorities with flexible
work arrangements. These include flexi-load (e.g. part-time), flexi-place
(e.g. telecommuting) and flexi-time (e.g. staggered hours), subject to
the operational requirements of the role and public agency.</p>
<h4>CoWork@Gov shared workspaces</h4>
<p>Public officers are able to work from a network of shared workspaces across
Singapore. These spaces offer officers flexibility in their workday, whether
they need a quiet spot to work between meetings, a convenient location
to catch up on tasks, or a collaborative environment for cross-agency discussions.
By making workspaces available at various locations, CoWork@Gov supports
a more mobile and connected Public Service, helping officers make better
use of their time while fostering opportunities for collaboration across
agencies.</p>

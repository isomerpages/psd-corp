<h4>ServiceSG: Driving a citizen-centric approach to public service delivery</h4>
<p>Under the Public Sector Transformation movement, ServiceSG has been working
across the whole of Government to transform the way public services are
delivered to citizens.</p>
<p>It has been driving a citizen-centric approach by integrating public services
across agencies, organising them around key life moments, and delivering
them to citizens through an omni-channel network of physical service centres,
a central call centre and a digital platform, LifeSG.</p>
<p>Each ServiceSG touchpoint provides citizens with access to multiple services
from different public sector agencies, improving citizens' experience of
Government services. For example, at ServiceSG centres, citizens can receive
assistance on close to 600 Government services and schemes from over 25
agencies.</p>

<h4><strong>Embracing innovative technology to deliver better services</strong></h4>
<h4>ICA: Transforming border clearance and security</h4>
<p>In 2024, the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) transformed
its checkpoint clearance operations.</p>
<p>It introduced passport-less immigration clearance at the land, sea, and
air checkpoints for Singapore residents. It also extended full automated
clearance to all travellers.</p>
<p>These technological leaps resulted in faster immigration clearance for
travellers, and enhanced security measures.</p>
<p>ICAâ€™s initiative exemplified the public sector's commitment to innovation
and efficiency in service delivery.</p>

<h4><strong>Streamlining common functions to better support those in need</strong></h4>
<p><strong>ComLink+</strong> streamlines support by pairing families with
dedicated coaches and volunteer befrienders. This integrated approach combines
professional guidance with personal support, enhancing our ability to help
families achieve long-term goals.</p>
<p><strong>The OneService App</strong> streamlines municipal service delivery
by connecting citizens, town councils, and agencies. It enables quick reporting
of issues, facilitates faster resolutions, and promotes community engagement,
ultimately enhancing the living environment for residents.</p>

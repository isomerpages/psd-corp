<h3><strong>Transforming for a better tomorrow</strong></h3>
<p>The speed of change around the world is accelerating. The once familiar
rules-based international security and economic orders are fracturing.
We face an ageing population, tight manpower resource base, rising citizen
expectations, fiscal constraints and technological disruption.</p>
<p>Achieving survival and success for Singapore and Singaporeans will require
fresh approaches in the way we do things, not just internally, but also
in how we connect with the world. To ensure we continue to serve Singapore
well, the Public Service has stepped up efforts to transform and plan for
tomorrow’s challenges, even as we adapt to meet the needs and problems
of today. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Transforming how we work as One Public Service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transforming and empowering our workforce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transforming our officers’ workplace experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>

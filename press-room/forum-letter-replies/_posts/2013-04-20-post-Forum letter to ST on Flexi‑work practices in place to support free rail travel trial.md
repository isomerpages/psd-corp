**Flexi-work practices in place to support free rail travel trial**

Following the Land Transport Authority’s announcement to provide a one-year trial for free rail travel into the city area before 7.45am, some members of the public wondered if employers would support this effort.

Public sector agencies welcome the LTA trial. Flexible work practices are in place for staff to take advantage of this as well as discounted travel between 7.45am and 8am.

More than 40 public agencies, which already offer staggered work hours, are located near the 16 MRT stations. Some 14,000 officers working in these agencies can opt to start work early (i.e. before 7.45am). Officers who start earlier will also end earlier as long as they put in the required hours a week. This flexibility is offered, depending on the nature of work to ensure that service to the public is maintained.

Many other public agencies outside the city area also offer the option of staggered work-hours. This is part of the Public Service’s range of flexible work practices, which include part-time work and telecommuting, to help public officers better manage their work and personal commitments.

The Public Service will continue to foster a more flexible work culture, one that ensures good work outcomes and a high level of service. Ultimately, workplace flexibility is about helping our officers to give their best at work to better serve the public.

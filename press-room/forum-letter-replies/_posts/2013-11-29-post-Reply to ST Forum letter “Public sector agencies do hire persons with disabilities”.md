**Public sector agencies do hire persons with disabilities**

We thank Mr Alvan Yap Boon Sheng for his letter, “Misconceptions about disabled employees” (The Straits Times, 27 Nov).  
  
Applicants for public sector jobs are asked to declare if they have a pre-existing physical disability or condition because these may influence the applicants’ suitability and ability to perform the job.  
  
A declaration, however, does not mean the applicant is then not considered for the job. As public sector agencies recruit based on merit, candidates with the best fit for the job will be hired.  
  
We do, in fact, have persons with disabilities working in our agencies.

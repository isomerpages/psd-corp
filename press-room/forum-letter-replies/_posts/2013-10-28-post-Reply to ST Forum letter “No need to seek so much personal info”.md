**Civil Service job forms follow fair employment guidelines**

We thank Mr Yiu Wing Lit for his letter “No need to seek so much personal info” (24 Oct). As a commitment towards fair employment practices, the Civil Service uses a common job application form which excludes fields such as date of birth, gender, marital status, race and religion. The form asks for information relating to citizenship and permanent residency as that can be a consideration in some sensitive positions such as those dealing with issues of national security. 

Likewise, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore uses the same form and requests certain personal information from candidates only after they are shortlisted for interview or selected for appointment, for administrative purposes. This practice is in line with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) guidelines to promote fair and non-discriminatory employment practices.

**Govt communication and service: PSD replies**

We thank the writers for their feedback on our service as well as our communication with those whom we serve.   
  
We agree on the importance of maintaining service standards, such as replying to public feedback in a timely manner, and coordinating across agencies to address the concerns of Singaporeans.   
  
We recognise that there is a need for us to explain things better, particularly where it is not possible to meet specific requests. Some of the more difficult problems also take more time to resolve. We seek the understanding of those who write in, and appreciate the importance of providing timely updates in these circumstances.   
  
Our agencies and officers remain committed to delivering good service so that policies can be implemented well and lives improved. We thank the writers for their good and constructive suggestions. They will help us to continue to improve the way we communicate and serve.

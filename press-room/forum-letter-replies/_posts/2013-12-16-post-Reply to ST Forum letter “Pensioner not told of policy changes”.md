**No recent changes to policies on hospitalisation and ward charges for pensioners**

We refer to Ms Audrey Cheong’s letter “Pensioner not told of policy changes” (ST Forum, 3 Dec 2013). 

We are sorry to hear about her friend’s hospitalisation. 

Ms Cheong was under the misapprehension that that there had been a change in policies relating to hospitalisation and ward charges for pensioners in recent years.

In fact, the only recent change, in March 2013, was to enhance outpatient medical and dental benefits with an increase in claim limits and subsidies.

For updates on policies and pension-related information, pensioners can refer to the Civil Service Pensioner’s Portal at [www.pac.gov.sg](http://www.pac.gov.sg/). 

We thank Ms Cheong for the opportunity to clarify and will look into better ways of sharing updates on pension policies with pensioners."

**Four in 10 public sector scholarship recipients study locally**

We thank Mr Richmond Lee for his comments in “Rethink undergrad studies abroad for public scholars” (19 September).

We agree that our local universities like NUS and NTU provide a high quality global education.

This is why the Public Service Commission (PSC) continues to award many scholarships for studies locally. This year, such awards accounted for about a fifth of the PSC scholarships given out. Outstanding candidates awarded such scholarships are given a well-rounded local undergraduate education with opportunities for overseas exposure. They are given the same grooming and development opportunities as their overseas counterparts.

In addition, beyond the PSC, the public sector as a whole awards scholarships to candidates for careers in various Ministries and Statutory Boards. About four in 10 public sector scholarship recipients were given awards to pursue their studies locally.

We continue to welcome applications from outstanding students with diverse experiences, strong character and above all, a commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans.

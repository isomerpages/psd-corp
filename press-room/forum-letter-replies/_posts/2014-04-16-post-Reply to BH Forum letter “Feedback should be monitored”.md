**Public Service takes feedback seriously**

We agree with Mr Mohd Ikhlash (“Feedback should be monitored”, 10 April) that feedback helps public agencies identify areas for improvement.

The Public Service takes feedback seriously. Every feedback received by REACH, the Government’s Feedback Unit, is assessed and channelled to the relevant agencies. In line with the public service delivery ethos, agencies will consider all feedback and decide on the actions required. Agencies also analyse the feedback received to continuously improve policies and provide better services to the public.

In recognition of the importance of service delivery, each agency also appoints a senior officer as its Quality Service Manager (QSM) to oversee the handling of feedback, as part of overall efforts to improve quality service. The QSMs will ensure that feedback and queries are addressed in a timely and responsive manner.  However, there may be times when agencies require more time to respond, particularly for complex issues that require detailed investigations or consultations with stakeholders.

We thank Mr Mohd Ikhlash for the opportunity to explain the way feedback is managed in the Public Service.

**Ongoing staff engagement to keep Code of Conduct relevant  
**  
We thank Mr Muhammad Dzul Azhan Haji Sahban for his letter calling for civil servants to be updated on our Code of Conduct ("Update civil servants on code of conduct"; Forum Online, Thursday).  
  
Our leaders do conduct town-hall sessions to discuss what the Code of Conduct means for their agencies and how it would apply to their staff as they go about their work daily.  
  
Such staff sessions, which were just held across the public service in recent months, allowed staff to reflect on their desired behaviour and actions and what should or should not be done.  
  
The Code is a live document that we keep fresh and relevant through regular reviews and updating to deal with new challenges and circumstances.  
  
Staff engagement continues as it is key to building shared values and ethos. It is also important that we continue to listen to staff concerns even as they live out the Code. We have new generations of officers joining the service, so the engagement continues.  
  
As public officers, the Code serves as a compass for us as we discharge our official duties. We will remain vigilant to guard against allowing anything that will erode the trust and confidence that Singaporeans have in the public service.

**Parliamentary Sitting: 20 Mar 2023**  
  
**Dr Shahira Abdullah:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government allocates mental health budgets for the welfare of civil servants; and (b) if so, what are the allocated budgets for the past three years.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service:**  
  
The Government provides a budget for staff welfare for civil servants, which agencies use to fund activities that improve employee physical and mental health and wellbeing, and show care and appreciation to staff.  We do not allocate a specific budget for mental health activities.

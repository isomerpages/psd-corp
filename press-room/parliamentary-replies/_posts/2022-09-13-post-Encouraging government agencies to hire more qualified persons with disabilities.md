**Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on encouraging government agencies to hire more qualified persons with disabilities**  

**Parliamentary Sitting: 13 Sep 2022**  
  
**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) what percentage of public service officers are persons with disabilities; (b) whether the Public Service Division plans to encourage Government agencies to hire more qualified people with disabilities so as to promote diversity and equality of opportunity; and (c) if so, in what ways.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service.**  
  
As at 31 Dec 2021, about 1 in 430 public officers are Persons with Disabilities.  
  
As an inclusive employer, the Public Service is committed to supporting the employment of Persons with Disabilities to take on meaningful jobs in accordance with their abilities. The Public Service Division has established an arrangement with SG Enable such that suitable job opportunities in the Public Service are advertised on SG Enable’s job portal. In addition, since 2019, potential job seekers who are Persons with Disabilities are introduced to HR teams across the Public Service on a regular basis, to encourage public agencies to actively consider them for job placement.

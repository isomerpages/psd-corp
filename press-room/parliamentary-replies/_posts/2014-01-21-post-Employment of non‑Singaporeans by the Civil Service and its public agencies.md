##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on employment of non-Singaporeans by the Civil Service and its public agencies

**Parliamentary Sitting: 21 January 2014**

**Mrs Lina Chiam:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether there are non-Singaporean citizens being employed by the Civil Service and public agencies under the Ministries of Trade and Industry, National Development, Finance and Manpower; (b) if so, why are non-Singaporeans employed to manage and shape policies affecting Singaporeans; and (c) whether policy formulation roles in all state bodies can be restricted to Singapore citizens only.

**Written Reply (for the Prime Minister) by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs**

Less than 5% of the total staff in these four ministries and their statutory boards are non-Singaporeans. None of these non-Singaporeans are in key jobs involving national-level policy formulation.

Singaporeans remain the core of the Public Service workforce. Non-Singaporeans are generally hired only for positions that are operational in nature or require skills that are in shortage amongst Singaporeans.

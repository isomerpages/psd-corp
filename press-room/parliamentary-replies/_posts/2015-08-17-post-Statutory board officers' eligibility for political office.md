**Parliamentary Sitting: 17 August 2015**  
**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song**: To ask the Prime Minister whether full-time employees of statutory boards are considered to be holders of a whole time office in the service of the Government and be disqualified from being Members of Parliament (MP) or being nominated for candidacy for election as an MP.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

The Constitution does not disqualify Statutory Board employees from running for office or becoming Members of Parliament as Statutory Boards are regarded in law as distinct entities from the Government.  
  
Most Statutory Boards have nonetheless aligned their practice to that of the Civil Service. Employees of these Statutory Boards are not allowed to hold office in political parties and stand for election to Parliament.  
  
For a small group of Statutory Boards which are not involved in policy formulation or implementation, such as institutions of higher learning, there is greater flexibility in the guidelines on participation in political activities. Employees of these Statutory Boards are generally allowed to join political parties and stand for election to Parliament unless they hold leadership positions in these entities.

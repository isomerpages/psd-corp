**Parliamentary Sitting Date: 3 April 2006**

Dr Tan Sze Wee: To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what is the mean household income for Public Service Commission (PSC) scholars who had their undergraduate education funded by the PSC, compared with the national average from 2003 to 2005; (b) if the PSC can provide information on the percentage of scholars who come from families that live in private housing; and (c) how does this percentage compare to the national average.

**Written Reply (for the Prime Minister) by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Defence:**

In 2005, 53% of PSC scholars came from households with monthly incomes above $5,000 while 47% came from households with monthly incomes below $5,000.  Based on the 2004 Labour Force Survey, 37% of Singapore households had monthly incomes above $5,000 and 63% had monthly incomes below $5,000.

In 2005, 47% of PSC scholars came from families who lived in private housing.  Based on the 2004 Labour Force Survey, 15% of all households lived in private housing.

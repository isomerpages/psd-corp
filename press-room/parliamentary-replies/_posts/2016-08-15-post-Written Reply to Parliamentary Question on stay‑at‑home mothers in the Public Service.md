**Parliamentary Sitting: 15 Aug 2016**

**Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether the public sector hires or engages stay-at-home mothers (not staff who go on flexible work arrangements); (b) if no, whether the public sector agencies can engage them for selected categories of work which stay-at-home mothers can perform from home; and (c) if yes, how many stay-at-home mothers are currently hired in the public sector.

Public service agencies offer a range of freelancing opportunities, from administration to research. Stay-at-home mothers with the relevant skills can apply for such work.  However, we are unable to gauge their numbers among successful applicants as their family status is not a criteria for job selection.   
  
Beyond freelancing opportunities, public service agencies also offer mothers long-term careers.  Where the nature of the jobs allow, mothers may apply to work on a part-time basis or telecommute from home.  As at the end of 2015, about 5% of mothers working in the civil service are on part-time arrangements.  An internal survey also showed that about one quarter of respondents who are mothers have telecommuted, including 10% who do so at least once a fortnight.

##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on rules for public officers on visiting gaming places

**Parliamentary Sitting Date: 22 November 2010**

Er Lee Bee Wah: To ask the Prime Minister in view of recent cases of cheating involving civil servants (a) what is the rule for public officers who visit gaming places such as casinos and the Singapore Turf Club; and (b) whether there are public officers who hold sensitive positions who are barred from visiting such gambling establishments.

**Written Reply (for the Prime Minister) by** **Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Defence:**

All civil servants are expected to conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the integrity of the Public Service and public confidence in it. This includes conducting themselves with propriety and not falling into financial embarrassment. Civil servants are prohibited from gambling during work hours and on official premises. They are also required to inform their respective Permanent Secretaries immediately if they are financially embarrassed or served with bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, all officers are required to make an annual declaration of indebtedness or non-indebtedness.

While there are no explicit guidelines to prohibit civil servants from gambling in their own time and capacities, to prevent situations where possible conflicts of interest may arise, there are restrictions imposed for certain groups of officers.  Police officers are not allowed to visit casinos while on duty, unless for official reasons, such as to investigate casino-related cases.  To avoid conflicts of interest, officers in the Casino Regulatory Authority are not allowed to participate in gaming activities within the casinos in Singapore or in overseas casinos belonging to the holding companies of the Singapore casino operators, even when they are not on duty.

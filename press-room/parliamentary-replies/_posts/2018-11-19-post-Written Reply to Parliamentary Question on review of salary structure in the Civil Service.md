**Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on review of salary structure in the Civil Service**  
  
**Parliamentary Sitting: 19 November 2018**  
  
**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) how often does the Public Service Division review the salary structure of the Civil Service; (b) when was the last review conducted; and (c) what are the salary scales for each of the Management Executive pay grades from 2010 to 2017.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade & Industry and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service.**  
  
The Civil Service’s pay philosophy is to keep pace with, but not lead the market. We will check that our salaries remain market competitive every year, but only adjust salaries where necessary. We have not made any major adjustments to salaries in the last few years.  
  
The last substantive change to the Management Executive Scheme (MXS) was in 2015, where MXS was extended to create a single career scheme for both degree and non-degree holders. Officers with the same potential and performance would be given the same opportunities for advancement and career development, regardless of their academic background.  
  
New officers in Executive roles on the MXS are generally paid a monthly salary starting from $3,100. The monthly salary for senior management Superscale officers, comprising around 1.9% of the Civil Service, starts from around $11,000.

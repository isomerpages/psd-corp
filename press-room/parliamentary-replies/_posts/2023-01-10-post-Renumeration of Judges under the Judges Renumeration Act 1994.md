##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on renumeration of Judges under the Judges Renumeration Act 1994

**Parliamentary Sitting: 10 Jan 2023**  
  
**Ms Hazel Poa:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) what are the fixed and variable non-pensionable pay components, allowances, and benefits accorded to Supreme Court Judges under the Judges' Remuneration Act 1994; (b) what are the rates at which the retirement and death gratuities are accrued for these judges; and (c) whether the remuneration of judges is benchmarked against that of political office holders.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service:**  
  
The annual salary package of Supreme Court Judge consists of six components: gross monthly salary, Annual Variable Component (AVC), Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance (NPAA), Performance Bonus (PB), National Bonus (NB) and Judiciary Allowance. The gross monthly salary comprises both fixed and variable components. Except for the Judiciary Allowance and the fixed monthly salary components, the other components may vary depending on economic conditions and individual performance. This structure is the same as civil servants of the equivalent substantive grade.   
  
The types of leave and medical benefits, including the retirement and death gratuity rates, are the same as civil servants of the equivalent substantive grade.  
  
The remuneration of judges has its own separate benchmark and is not linked to that of political office holders.

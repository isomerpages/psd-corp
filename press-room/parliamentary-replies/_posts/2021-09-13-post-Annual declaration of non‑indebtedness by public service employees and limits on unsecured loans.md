**Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on annual declaration of non-indebtedness by public service employees and limits on unsecured loans**

**Parliamentary Sitting: 13 September 2021**  
  
**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether all public servants are required to make annual declarations of non-indebtedness; (b) if so, what is the maximum amount of unsecured loans each officer can have vis-a-vis their monthly income; (c) whether there is any obligation on the part of officers to report fellow officers whom they know have exceeded this amount; and (d) what are the consequences for non-reporting.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service.**  
  
Every public officer has a duty to maintain high standards of personal conduct and integrity. This includes living within one’s means so as not to become financially embarrassed.  All officers have to make an annual declaration of their non-indebtedness. They must also immediately declare to their Permanent Secretary or the Chief Executive of the statutory boards when their unsecured debts and liabilities exceed 3 months of their monthly salary.  
  
To reinforce high standards of integrity, conduct and accountability, there are established internal channels for officers to report wrongful practices or behaviours they have observed in the workplace to their Heads of Department.  Based on the reporting guidelines, officers can report their fellow officers who have become financially embarrassed in good faith.

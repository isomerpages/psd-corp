**Parliamentary Sitting: 16 Aug 2016**  
  
**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) how many female pensioners are there currently who have retired before 2005; (b) whether the Ministry will consider extending equal medical benefits to this group of pensioners' dependants especially spouses; and (c) how much is the projected incremental pension expenditure should equal benefits be extended to the pensioners' dependants including spouses.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service.** 
  
There are currently 8,400 female pensioners who retired before 2005.  
  
Since 2005, all officers, male and female, on the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (or MSO) scheme can claim medical benefits for their spouse, and for their dependant unmarried children below the age of 18. Pensioners and serving officers on the older medical schemes can opt to convert to the MSO scheme at any time.  However, as the older medical schemes offer more generous benefits than the MSO scheme, few have done so.   
  
If medical coverage were to be extended to the dependants of all female pensioners and serving officers currently enrolled in the older medical schemes, the additional cost would exceed $30 million annually.  
  
All Singaporeans, including the dependants and spouses of female pensioners on older civil service medical schemes, now benefit from lifelong protection provided by MediShield Life.  
  
In addition, those who are Pioneers also enjoy the benefits of the Pioneer Generation Package.  This includes subsidies for healthcare and Medisave top-ups which will help with their healthcare costs. Medisave top-ups for dependants who are pioneers, and Medishield Life coverage continue even after the life-time of the pensioner, unlike civil service medical benefits.

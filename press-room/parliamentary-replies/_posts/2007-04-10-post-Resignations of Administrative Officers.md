**Parliamentary Sitting Date: 10 April 2007**

Mr Siew Kum Hong: To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for each of the years from 2004 to 2006 (a) how many officers resigned from the Administrative Service and what resignation rate did that represent; (b) of these resignations, how many Administrative Officers cited higher pay in a new job as the main reason or one of the main reasons; and (c) how many Administrative Officers were asked to resign for reasons related to non-performance.

**Oral Reply (for the Prime Minister) by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Defence:**

The number of Administrative Officers who resigned from the Administrative Service in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were 4, 10 and 7 respectively. This corresponds to resignation rates of 2%, 4% and 3% respectively.   If we include Management Associates, who are the officers being tested for suitability for the Administrative Service, the resignation numbers are larger.  The total number of AOs and MAs who resigned in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were 4, 14 and 12 respectively.  This corresponds to resignation rates of 1%, 4 % and 3% respectively.

Administrative Officers leave the Service for various reasons and we may often not be able to ascertain exactly the real reasons for their departure. Some indicated that they would like to further their studies while others want to have a change of career. Some of those who leave for jobs in the private sector enjoy a pay increase in their new jobs.  

The Administrative Service has very stringent retention standards. Officers are appraised annually and are expected to have the potential to hold at least Deputy Secretary or CEO level jobs. Those who do not meet the mark are asked to leave the Service but they could remain in other schemes in the Civil Service if they wish and if there are suitable jobs for them.  Over the last three years, a total of 13 Administrative Officers left the Service on such grounds. Of these, 8 officers left the Public Service. The other 5 transferred to join other schemes within the Public Service where they continue to contribute to the public service.

##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on statistics on pensioners and impact of Medishield Life on them

**Parliamentary Sitting: 8 July 2014**  
  
**Mr Png Eng Huat:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) as of June 2014, what is the number of pensioners under the Fixed Amount On Ward Scheme (FAW), Co-Payment On Ward Scheme (CPW) and Comprehensive Co-Payment Scheme (CCS); and (b) what is the financial impact of Medishield Life on these pensioners.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs**

The Fixed Amount on Ward (FAW), Co-Payment on Ward Scheme (CPW) and Comprehensive Co-Payment Scheme (CCS) are older medical schemes in the Civil Service that have since been phased out. New officers are no longer placed on these medical schemes.  Of the 32,000 pensioners today, about 60% are on FAW \[3%\] and CPW \[57%\], while 40% are on CCS.

On 4 July 2014, the Public Service Division announced the measures taken by the government to help pensioners under the various medical benefits schemes to ensure that pensioners will benefit from MediShield Life coverage and be no worse off in their current medical benefits.

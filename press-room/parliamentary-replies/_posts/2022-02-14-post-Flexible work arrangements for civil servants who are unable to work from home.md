##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on flexible work arrangements for civil servants who are unable to work from home

**Parliamentary Sitting: 14 February 2022**  
  
**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is the current number and percentage of civil servants who are deemed to be unable to work from home based on their job functions; (b) whether these civil servants are eligible for flexible work arrangements (FWAs); and (c) if so, what do these encompass.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service.**  
  
Some 60% of the civil service are in frontline functions, such as schools or the uniformed services agencies, which are not suited to be performed from home on a sustained basis.  
  
However, where operationally feasible, Public Service agencies can exercise flexibility and discuss Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) with these officers. These include part-time work arrangements and flexi-hours, which can support officers in balancing their work and personal circumstances.

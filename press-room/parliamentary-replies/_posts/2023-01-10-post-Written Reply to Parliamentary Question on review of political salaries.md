**Parliamentary Sitting: 10 Jan 2023**  
  
**Ms Hazel Poa:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether he has appointed a committee to carry out the five-yearly review of political salaries, given that the last committee was appointed in 2017; (b) if so, what are the terms of reference given to the committee and when can the public expect the report from the committee; and (c) if not, when is this committee expected to be appointed and what are its expected terms of reference.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service:**  
  
The 2012 White Paper on Salaries for a Capable and Committed Government had recommended that an independent committee be appointed every five years to review the salary framework for political appointment holders.   
  
In 2018, the Government provided its response to the latest review of political salaries by an independent committee.  The committee had concluded then that the salary framework remained relevant and sound, and its recommendations included adjusting the salary levels of political appointment holders to match the updated benchmark. The Government decided not to make any changes to political salaries, since the  economy was still in transition. The Government indicated then that it would review the matter again after five years, or when it becomes necessary.  
  
The next political salaries review is targeted for 2023, and we will share more details in due course.

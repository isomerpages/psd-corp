##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the rate of uptake of parent-care leave the public and private sectors from 2014 to 2016

**Parliamentary Sitting: 11 September 2017**  
  
**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang**: To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is the rate of uptake of parent-care leave by public servants for each year in the past three years; and (b) what is the number of private companies that currently offer parent-care leave.  
  
**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister in charge of the Civil Service.**  
  
Civil servants can take up to two days of parent-care leave a year. In the past three years, 39% (2014), 40% (2015), and 42% (2016) of civil servants took parent-care leave.  
  
Parent-care leave is not legislated. Based on a Ministry of Manpower survey in 2016, only 19% of employers offer parent-care leave.

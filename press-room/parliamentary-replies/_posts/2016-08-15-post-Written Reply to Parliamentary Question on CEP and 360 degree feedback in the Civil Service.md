**Parliamentary Sitting: 15 Aug 2016**

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang**: To ask the Prime Minister whether the Ministry will be able to (i) provide greater transparency on the scoring methodology used to determine a civil servant's Current Estimated Potential (CEP) as well as an officer's CEP score at a point in time and (ii) implement a 360-degree feedback appraisal system for civil servants which is currently common practice in the private sector.

The Civil Service uses Currently Estimated Potential (CEP) as one tool to plan for the career development of officers.  CEP is expressed in terms of the highest job responsibility level an officer is currently assessed to be capable of handling in the future.  Hence an officer’s CEP may change with assessment over time.  CEP is assessed based on demonstrated “AIM” qualities, which stand for (1) Analytical and Intellectual Capacity; (2) Influence and Collaboration; and (3) Motivation for Excellence.  After a supervisor assesses his officer for CEP, the assessment is subject to counter-signing and ranking processes at the Ministry level, to ensure that the assessment is robust and fair.  
  
All officers have access to information on the CEP assessment framework and definitions of the AIM qualities through Instruction Manuals, assessment guides, and training by the Civil Service College.  Our agencies also encourage supervisors to have frank conversations with officers and help them along in their career development. We are placing emphasis on developing supervisors so that they are better prepared to coach their officers.   
  
The Civil Service encourages timely and regular feedback as part of the appraisal process.  Today, leaders receive 360 degree feedback on their leadership qualities when they attend milestone leadership development programmes.  The feedback helps them to understand their strengths, developmental areas and blind spots, and motivates them to improve.  For other officers, the feedback loop is generally between officers and their supervisors through day to day interactions and work review sessions which culminate in the completion of their Individual Development Plans. The Civil Service is looking into ways to make “giving timely feedback to one another” a cultural norm.

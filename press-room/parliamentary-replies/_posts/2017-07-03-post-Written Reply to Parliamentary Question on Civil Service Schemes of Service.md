**Parliamentary Sitting: 3 July 2017**  
  
**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang**: To ask the Prime Minister (a) how many officers on the Civil Service's Management Support Scheme have been and are to be transferred to the Management Executive Scheme; and (b) whether the Management Support Scheme will be phased out.   
  
**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister in charge of the Civil Service.**   
  
Transfers from the Management Support Scheme to the Management Executive Scheme are not compulsory. Serving officers have the option to transfer to the extended Management Executive Scheme or remain on the Management Support Scheme. As of May 2017, 2,465 (42%) Management Support Officers have transferred to the extended Management Executive Scheme.   
  
While we no longer recruit officers on the Management Support Scheme, it will not be phased out until the last officer transfers out or retires from the scheme. Officers are free to transfer to the extended Management Executive Scheme whenever they are ready. Officers can engage their supervisors and HR departments on the career pathway that would best fulfil their aspirations before coming to a decision.

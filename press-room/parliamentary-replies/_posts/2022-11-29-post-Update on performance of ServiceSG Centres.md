**Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on update on performance of ServiceSG Centres**

**Parliamentary Sitting: 29 Nov 2022**  
  
**Miss Cheryl Chan:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether he can provide an update on the performance of the ServiceSG Centres since their inception; (b) what are the top five service requests received across these centres; and (c) whether there are any target number of centres to be added if the early pilots have demonstrated to be successful.  
  
**Oral Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service:**  
  
In 2022, the Public Service set up a total of 4 ServiceSG Centres, bringing the total number of centres to 5. These centres are at Our Tampines Hub, One Punggol, Heartbeat@Bedok, Nee Soon Central Community Club, and The Frontier Community Club.   
  
The Public Service seeks to digitalise its services to serve Singaporeans better and more efficiently. However, we appreciate that there will be citizens who need some help to transact with the government digitally, or need help to navigate multiple government services. Therefore, we set up these ServiceSG centres to serve as one-stop physical touchpoints where officers can guide citizens through digital transactions and offer integrated services across different public agencies for citizens. The centres at OTH and OP provide over 400 services and the other centres in CCs provide over 200 services.    
  
From January to November 2022, ServiceSG centres completed over 180,000 transactions. A high percentage of the citizens served at these centres are the elderly. The commonly requested services at the ServiceSG centres are assistance with SingPass, enquiry on government schemes, Community Club related enquiries and course bookings, assistance with CPF matters and assistance with tax matters.  
  
The citizen satisfaction rate across these centres is at over 90%, on average. We have also received positive feedback from citizens, for the efforts to offer multiple, integrated services to them.   
  
The ServiceSG centre is still a service transformation pilot by the Public Service Division. While the initial feedback is encouraging, we will continue to seek feedback and improve the service delivery, and conduct a proper evaluation of this pilot. If these centres indeed prove to be well utilized and helpful to citizens, we will plan for more centres in tandem with demand, prioritizing areas where there is a higher concentration of citizens (eg seniors) who have greater need for support with multiple digital transactions. As of now, we are planning for two more centres located at Keat Hong CC and Bukit Canberra.

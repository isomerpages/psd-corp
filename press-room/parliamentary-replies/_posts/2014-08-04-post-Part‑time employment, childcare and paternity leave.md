##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on part-time employment, childcare and paternity leave

**Parliamentary Sitting: 4 August 2014**

Mr Seah Kian Peng: To ask the Prime Minister (a) for statutory boards and Ministries, what is the respective range of take-up rates for (i) part-time employment scheme by Division 1 officers and non-Division 1 officers; (ii) childcare leave of six days per year for parents with children aged 6 and below and the extended childcare leave of two days per year for children aged 7-12; (iii) paternity leave; and (b) for each of these indicators, which are the top and bottom five statutory boards and Ministries respectively. 

**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

The Public Service supports the needs of our officers.  We provide leave benefits and offer flexible work arrangements like part-time employment. In 2013, 1,488 (1.7%) Division 1 officers and 318 (0.6%) non-Division 1 officers were on part time employment. 72% of eligible public officers used the 6-day childcare leave and 48% of eligible public officers used the 2-day extended childcare leave. 78% of eligible public officers used their paternity leave. It is not meaningful to compare part-time employment and leave take-up rate across ministries and statutory boards, given their diverse work nature and employee profile.

**Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the hiring of workers above the re-employment age of 67 across Ministries and Statutory Boards**
  
**Parliamentary Sitting: 19 March 2018**  
  
**Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan:** To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is the Public Service Division's position on the hiring of workers above the re-employment age of 67 years across Ministries and statutory boards; and (b) whether Ministries and statutory boards are free to hire or extend employment beyond 67 years of age.  

**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister in charge of the Civil Service.**

Public agencies can hire or re-employ officers who are above 67 years old as long as their services are needed. As at 31 December 2017, there are about 1,400 public officers who are aged 67 and above.

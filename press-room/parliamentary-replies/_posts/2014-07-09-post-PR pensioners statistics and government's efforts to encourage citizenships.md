##### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on PR pensioners statistics and government's efforts to encourage citizenships

**Parliamentary Sitting: 9 July 2014**  
  
Mr Png Eng Huat: To ask the Prime Minister (a) as of 2014, what is the number of permanent resident pensioners; and (b) what have been the Government's efforts to encourage these pensioners to take up citizenship.

**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

There are 230 pensioners who are Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs). They account for less than 1% of Government pensioners. As the pension scheme has largely been discontinued since 1986, these pensioners would have joined the civil service many years ago.  
   
Over the years, the Government as an employer has been encouraging public officers who are PRs to take up citizenship. Our agencies initiate regular conversations with these officers to explain the obligations and benefits of citizenship. They too, can see that our citizens get more support and benefits in areas such as housing, healthcare, education, and marriage and parenthood. Obligations and benefits aside, the decision to take up citizenship is a serious commitment which is ultimately a personal decision.

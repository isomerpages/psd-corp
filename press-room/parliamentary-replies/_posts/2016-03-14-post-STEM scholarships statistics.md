**Parliamentary Sitting: 14 March 2016**  
  
**Mr Png Eng Huat**: To ask the Prime Minister (a) for each of the years from 2007 to 2012, how many undergraduate scholarships were offered by PSC, DSTA and A\*STAR for local students to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses overseas; and (b) how many of these scholars ended up breaking their bonds.Â   

**Written Reply by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service:**

From 2007 to 2012, the Public Service Commission (PSC), Agency For Science, Technology And Research (A\*STAR) and Defence Science And Technology Agency (DSTA) awarded a total of 511 overseas undergraduate scholarships for STEM courses or an average of 85 per year.  
  
Of these 511 overseas undergraduate STEM scholarship recipients, the majority, or 487, are still studying or working in the various agencies. The remaining 24 left the service before completing their bonds.  
  
Other public sector agencies, such as the Public Utilities Board (PUB), Economic Development Board (EDB) and Land Transport Authority (LTA) also offer undergraduate scholarships for STEM courses every year. From 2007 to 2012, approximately 200 scholarships a year were awarded to students to read STEM courses both locally and overseas. This number has been rising since 2013.

**Parliamentary Sitting: 10 July 2012**

Mr Zainal Sapari: To ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider  increasing  the  quantum  of  medical subsidies  for  civil  servants under the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) Scheme which is currently capped at $350 a year for outpatient treatment.

**Written Reply (for the Prime Minister) by** **Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister in charge of the Civil Service and Minister for Home Affairs:**

The Civil Service reviews its medical benefits periodically to ensure that they are adequate. The latest review will be completed in the second half of this year and we will make adjustments, if necessary. I had informed the House of this during the Committee of Supply Debate earlier this year.

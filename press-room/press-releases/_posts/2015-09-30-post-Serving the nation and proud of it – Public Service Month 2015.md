**Serving the nation and proud of it**  
Public Service Month 2015

As part of celebrations to mark Singapore’s Golden Jubilee, 141,000 public officers will renew their pledge to serve Singapore and Singaporeans. They will do this at observance ceremonies islandwide across ministries and statutory boards in October during Public Service Month.  
  
In addition, Public Service Month will be marked with a series of activities to recognise the good work of public officers, celebrate the Public Service journey, and foster a sense of pride in the Public Service. This is the first time that the annual Public Service Week has been extended to a month-long celebration.  
  
<u>**Highlights of Public Service Month**</u>  

\- Public Service Festival on 15-17 October, comprising of an exhibition, workshops and interactive activities, will bring to life the transformation of the Singapore Public Service over the past 50 years and offer a glimpse into the future.   
\- A two-volume book-set, Heart of Public Service, that honours the institutions and officers of the Public Service will also be launched at the festival. Touching on the key milestones in our history, Heart of Public Service features Singapore’s development through stories about our public institutions and showcases how public officers live out the core values of Integrity, Service and Excellence. It will include stories of how public officers keep Singapore running 24/7, serving the nation and fellow Singaporeans from their hearts.   
\- The annual Excellence in Public Service Awards (ExPSA) and PS21 Excellence through Continuous Enterprise and Learning (ExCEL) Awards Ceremony will recognise public officers and agencies for their service and innovation excellence.  
\- Learning journeys will be organised for public officers to appreciate and gain new perspectives on various government agencies’ work.   
  
Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also Minister in charge of the Civil Service, said, “SG50 has been an eventful year for Singapore. Our public officers have worked hard, often behind the scenes, including during the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the 28th SEA Games and the SG50 celebrations. I want to thank all our officers for their hard work and dedication to ensure that the events took place smoothly and safely for everyone. Let us continue to give our best together as one Public Service, working with the Government and all Singaporeans to build a better future for Singapore and Singaporeans."   
    
Head, Civil Service, Peter Ong, hopes that in this month-long celebration, officers will take time to come together and reflect on what has been accomplished as a Public Service. He said, “Our people are the heart of the Public Service. Many serve with passion and dedication, and are exemplary in the way they do their work and conduct themselves. In this special year, we want to honour both our past and present officers. A career in the Public Service is a calling. And as we look forward to the future, let us continue to uphold the ethos of serving Singapore and Singaporeans to the best of our abilities.”  
  
Public Service Month will end with a reception for long service medallists and PS21 Star Service Awardees to be hosted by the President at the Istana on 20 October.

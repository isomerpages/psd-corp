This year’s Public Service Week will  be from 16 to 22 May, where 143,000 public officers – working in 16 Ministries and more than 50 Statutory Boards – will renew their pledge to serve Singapore and Singaporeans.   
  
The week-long activities include observance ceremonies to foster a sense of pride and belonging in the Public Service, as well as learning journeys to better understand the work of colleagues in different agencies.   The annual Excellence in Public Service Awards Ceremony and Istana Reception will also be held to recognise the good work of public officers. The Awards ceremony will be graced by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also the Minister in charge of the Civil Service. President Tony Tan Keng Yam will host the Istana Reception.   
  
Reminding public officers of the important role they play in nation building, Head of Civil Service Peter Ong said, “To position Singapore for the future and deliver greater public value to citizens, public officers need to work ever more closely together, both internally among agencies and externally with stakeholders and customers.  Many of us joined the Public Service, inspired to make a difference to Singapore and Singaporeans. Let us continue to serve as One Public Service.”  
  
In a video produced by Public Service Division (PSD) to mark this year’s Public Service Week, DPM Teo extends his thanks to public officers and encourages them to continue their good work. DPM Teo’s full message is extracted below for your reference.  
  
“You have just heard from our colleagues in the Public Service. The work they do every day makes a big difference for Singaporeans; educating our children for the future, keeping us safe, making us healthier, building stronger social bonds, and a better and more prosperous Singapore for the future. Each of us in our own way contributes to this mission.   
  
Over the past 50 years, the Public Service and all our public officers have built the Singapore today. It is a Singapore we can all be proud of. Since the last General Election, we have a new Cabinet, and a number of Permanent Secretaries have also been newly appointed to their positions. They will bring new energy and ideas, and help lead the Public Service and guide us in our work.   
  
So let us all work together in the coming years to build a better Singapore, for all of us. Partner with Singaporeans to take Singapore into the future, for the next 50 years.   
  
Thank you very much for your hard work.”

_Public Service Week 2021_

Themed “Emerging Stronger as One Public Service”, Public Service Week (PSW) 2021 celebrates the spirit of the Public Service in seizing new opportunities arising from the pandemic to transform and build a brighter future for Singapore.   
  
In accordance with safe management measures, the PSW 2021 events will be held virtually and open to all public officers. More information can be found at [www.publicserviceweek.gov.sg](https://www.publicserviceweek.gov.sg/).

The key events of PSW1 include:

&emsp; i. &emsp; <u>One Public Service Observance Ceremony (OPSOC), 9 July</u>

The OPSOC is a key platform for all public officers across the Public Service to reaffirm their commitment to the Public Service. Officers in the various ministries and agencies renewed our pledge as One Public Service in service of Singaporeans and Singapore, as well as reflect upon our collective fight  to manage COVID-19. Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, Mr Chan Chun Sing, spoke about the new challenges we face, and how the Public Service need to evolve fast to seize new opportunities as we rebuild our economy, society and people in the post-COVID-19 world. 

 &emsp; ii. &emsp; <u>Public Sector Transformation (PST) Awards Ceremony, 30 July</u>

The PST Awards Ceremony is a Whole-of-Government pinnacle platform to recognise public agencies and officers for excellence in their work and organisational practices. This year, there are 84 PST awards winners across 11 categories.   
  
At the Awards Ceremony, Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, Mr Chan Chun Sing, shared the importance of PST and conveyed his appreciation to all public officers who have been working tirelessly to serve Singapore. 

&emsp; iii. &emsp; <u>PST Convention and Learning Festival, through July and August</u>

Comprising a series of four webinars on the Future of Work, Future Workforce, and Future Workplace, the PST Convention is designed to inspire and encourage all public officers to embrace PST. Each webinar will have a panel of distinguished leaders from the private and/or public sectors, to share their invaluable insights and experiences with public officers. The Learning Festival aims to support all officers in strengthening their skills and competencies and stay relevant.

&emsp;A job scam website has been reposting a number of job openings published on the Careers@Gov portal onto their website (jobsingapore24h.com). We have lodged a police report and the matter is currently under investigation. We have contacted the site owner and requested for all Public Service-related job postings to be taken down.   
  
2 &emsp;We would like to remind jobseekers to only apply for Public Service job openings on the Careers@Gov portal, or the hiring agencies’ recruitment sites. Jobseekers should not submit their personal information or resumes via unauthorised platforms, which can potentially lead to scams, information theft or identity theft. If in doubt, they should check with the relevant public agencies on the job openings.

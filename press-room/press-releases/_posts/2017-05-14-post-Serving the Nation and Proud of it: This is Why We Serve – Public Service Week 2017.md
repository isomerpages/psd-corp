This year’s Public Service Week will be from 15 to 21 May, where 145,000 public officers in 16 Ministries and more than 50 Statutory Boards will renew their pledge to serve Singapore and Singaporeans.   
  
The week-long activities include observance ceremonies to foster a sense of pride and belonging in the Public Service and learning journeys to better understand the work of colleagues in different agencies. The annual Istana Reception and Excellence in Public Service Awards Ceremony will also be held to recognise the good work of public officers. President Tony Tan Keng Yam will host the Istana Reception, while the Awards Ceremony will be graced by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also the Minister in charge of the Civil Service.   
  
In a video produced by Public Service Division (PSD) to mark this year’s Public Service Week, to be released on 15 May, DPM Teo will extend his thanks to public officers and encourage them to continue their good work. DPM Teo’s full message is extracted below for your reference.  
  
"Thank you to each and everyone of you for working quietly, tirelessly, for Singapore and for all our fellow Singaporeans. Each one of you, in your own work, and in your work as teams, has made a contribution.   
  
Let us work together to help Singapore transform for the future. We will work together to learn new skills, to learn new processes, to work with new programmes and new ideas and new ways to serve Singaporeans for the future. We also must hold true to our values of integrity, service and excellence, which has given us a good government and a good Public Service.   
  
I would like to thank all of you once again for your hard work in the past year and look forward to working with you in the year ahead. Let me also wish you and all your families all the very best. Thank you very much."

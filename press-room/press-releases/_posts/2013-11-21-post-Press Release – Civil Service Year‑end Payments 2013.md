**Civil Service Year-end Payments**

**_Civil Servants to get year-end AVC of 1.1 months with lower-wage officers getting at least $1,600_**

The Singapore economy grew by 5.8% on a year-on-year basis and 1.3% on a seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter annualised basis in the third quarter of 2013. Based on the Ministry of Trade and Industry’s forecast, Singapore’s GDP growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4% for 2013, supported by the slight pickup in the global economy and resilient domestically-oriented sectors like construction and business services. 

Against this economic backdrop, civil servants will get a year-end Annual Variable Component (AVC) of 1.1 months, with lower-wage officers getting an AVC of at least $1,600. This signals the Government’s continued commitment to help lower-wage workers.

Some 1,300 civil servants earning less than $1,460 will benefit from the minimum AVC payment of $1,600. For example, an officer earning a monthly salary of $1,200 will get a year-end AVC of $1,600. This is $280 more than the $1,320 he would be getting at 1.1 months of his monthly salary. 

The year-end AVC payment was decided in consultation with the public sector unions.

All civil servants will also get the Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance (NPAA) of 1 month, to be paid in December along with the AVC.

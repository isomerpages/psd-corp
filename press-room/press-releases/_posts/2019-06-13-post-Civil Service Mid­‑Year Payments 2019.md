***Civil Service Mid-Year Payments***

**Mid-Year Annual Variable Component of 0.45 month in July.**  

**In addition:   
Greater support for lower-wage civil servants.**  

Based on preliminary estimates, the Singapore economy grew by 1.2% in the first quarter of 2019 and is expected to grow by 1.5% to 2.5% for the full year. On the labour market front, total employment continued to grow. Overall unemployment rates and resident unemployment rates held steady, although the citizen unemployment rate inched up and retrenchments rose compared to the previous quarter.

Against this backdrop and taking into consideration the recommendations of the National Wages Council, and in close consultation with the public sector unions, the Government will be making the following mid-year payments:

*   A mid-year Annual Variable Component (AVC) of 0.45 month and a one-off lump sum payment of $200 for all civil servants. Lower-wage civil servants in Grades IV and V of the Operations Support Scheme (OSS) will receive a higher lump sum of $300; and
*   Built-in wage increase of up to $50 for civil servants in Grade V of the OSS, over and above their annual increment. 

The above mid-year payments signal the Government’s continued commitment to support our lower-wage civil servants. Around 1,400 civil servants will benefit from the higher lump sum payment.

The mid-year payments will be made in July 2019. The Government will decide on the year-end AVC payment for civil servants after taking into consideration Singapore’s economic performance in the second half of 2019.

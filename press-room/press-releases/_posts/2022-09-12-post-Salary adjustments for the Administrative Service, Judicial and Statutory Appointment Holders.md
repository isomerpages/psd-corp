_Administrative Officers and Judicial and Statutory Appointment Holders will receive salary adjustments between 5% and 12%, to keep pace with the market and enable the Civil Service to attract and retain a fair share of talent for key leadership roles._  
  
The Public Service Division (PSD) will be adjusting the salaries of the Administrative Service and Judicial and selected Statutory Appointment Holders, which were last adjusted almost 15 years ago in 2007/2008.   
  
Since then, gaps with market benchmarks have increased significantly. These adjustments will enable the Public Service to continue to attract and retain its fair share of talent for key leadership roles.   
  
To narrow the gaps, the salaries of the Administrative Service and Judicial and Statutory Appointment Holders will be adjusted by between 5% and 12%. The salary ranges will also be adjusted.    
  
The effective date for the salary adjustments is 1 October 2022.  
  
About 300 Administrative Officers and 30 Judicial and Statutory Appointment Holders will benefit from the salary revision. The Judicial Appointment Holders include the Chief Justice, Judges of the Court of Appeal, Judges of the Appellate Division, Judges of the High Court, and Judicial Commissioners. The selected Statutory Appointment Holders include the Attorney-General, Deputy Attorneys-General, Public Service Commission Chairman, and Auditor-General.  
  
As a progressive employer, beyond providing competitive salaries, the Public Service will continue to strengthen development efforts across all schemes of service. Administrative Officers can continue to look forward to job rotations, attachments in the private and people sectors, as well as leadership milestone programmes. These efforts will enable our officers to give their best in service of Singapore and Singaporeans. The Public Service will continue to periodically review salaries of public officers and adjust them when necessary to broadly keep pace with, but not lead, the market.

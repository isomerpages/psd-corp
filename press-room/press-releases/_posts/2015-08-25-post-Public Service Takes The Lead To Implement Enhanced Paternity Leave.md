**Public Service takes the lead to implement enhanced paternity leave** 

The Public Service supports national efforts to strengthen the family-friendly environment in Singapore. Recognising the father’s role in caring for and raising children, the Public Service, with a workforce of 141,000, will take the lead in implementing the enhanced paternity leave announced by the Prime Minister at the National Day Rally 2015.  

Male public officers will now be eligible for a total of two weeks of paternity leave, instead of one week, if they have a Singapore Citizen child born on or after 1 January 2015. The paternity leave can be taken within 12 months from the birth of the child.

**Civil servants appreciated with a 1.0-month year-end bonus.  
Junior grade officers to receive additional payment of $500** 

_In recognition of the sustained hard work and diverse contributions of officers in the fight against COVID-19, the Government, in close consultation with the public sector unions, will pay all civil servants a year-end bonus of 1.0 month. Civil servants in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, as well as those in OSS Grades III to V will receive an additional one-time payment of $500. The Government will continue to pay the Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance of 1.0 month to all civil servants._  
  
Over the past year, public officers have continued to dedicate themselves to the national fight against COVID-19 and have worked tirelessly to keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe.  
  
In addition, Singapore’s economy remains on track for a recovery in 2021. The economy expanded by 7.1% on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter of 2021 and the Ministry of Trade and Industry has updated its GDP growth forecast to “around 7.0%” for 2021.  On the labour market front, resident employment grew more quickly in the third quarter, particularly in outward-oriented industries, and unemployment rates declined for the second consecutive month in September 2021.   
  
In recognition of their sustained hard work and diverse contributions, and against the backdrop of the economic recovery, the Government, in close consultation with the public sector unions, has decided to pay all civil servants a year-end Annual Variable Component (AVC) of 1.0 month. In line with the National Wages Council’s recommendations to uplift the wages of lower-wage workers, civil servants in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, as well as those in OSS Grades III to V will receive an additional one-time lump-sum payment of $500. Taken together with the mid-year payments, civil servants will receive a total of 1.3 months in full-year AVC, with those in more junior grades receiving an additional one-time payment of up to $1,200 in 2021.  
  
The Government will continue to pay the Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance (NPAA – 13th month bonus) of 1.0 month to all civil servants.  
   
The Public Service has demonstrated tenacity and resolve in the prolonged battle against COVID-19. The Government deeply appreciates the hard work and perseverance of all public officers in the fight against the pandemic. Working together, we will emerge stronger from this crisis, as a nation.

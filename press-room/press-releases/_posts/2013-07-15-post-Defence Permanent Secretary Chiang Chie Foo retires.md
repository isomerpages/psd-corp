He held several key appointments in the public sector in the areas of security, education and defence, including being Director, Internal Security Department and Principal Private Secretary (PPS) to the First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong (and later as PPS to the Prime Minister when Mr Goh became the PM). 

    Mr Chiang was appointed Second Permanent Secretary (Education) in 1997 and then PS (Education) from 1999 to 2004.

    When Mr Chiang was PS (Prime Minister’s Office) from 2005 to 2011, he led several national committees and played an important role in developing population policies and engaging overseas Singaporeans.

    Mr Chiang has been PS (Defence) since 2004 and has ensured that MINDEF and the SAF remain capable and operationally ready.  He established an integrated approach to defence planning and spearheaded a strategic framework for the transformation to a Third Generation SAF.  He also guided changes in the uniformed schemes of service which placed MINDEF and the SAF in a strong position to continue to recruit and retain talent. Mr Chiang has also made significant contributions towards strengthening bilateral defence ties with countries within our region and around the world.  

    Mr Chiang was awarded the Public Administration Medal (Gold) in 1997 and the Meritorious Service Medal in 2007 for his significant contributions to the Public Service.

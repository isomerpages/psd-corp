_Public Service Week 2020_

&emsp; Themed “Together, we can overcome as One Public Service”, this year’s Public Service Week (PSW) 2020 in October celebrates the spirit of coming together as One Public Service to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also an opportunity for all public officers to reaffirm our commitment to serve Singaporeans better and build a brighter future for Singapore, as we accelerate Public Sector Transformation (PST) even amidst the current crisis.

In accordance with safe management measures, the PSW 2020 events will be held virtually. The key events of PSW1 include:

&emsp; i. &emsp; <u>One Public Service Observance Ceremony (OPSOC), 16 October</u>

For the first time this year, OPSOC brought together all public officers to renew our pledge as One Public Service in the service of Singaporeans and Singapore. It was also an occasion for the whole Public Service to reflect on this exceptional year.    

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a special message, conveyed his appreciation to officers who have been working tirelessly in the fight against COVID-19. In his speech, Minister-in-Charge of the Public Service, Mr Chan Chun Sing encouraged public officers to  continue to look ahead and anticipate future challenges, so that Singapore continues to remain relevant on the global stage, as well as thrive in a post-COVID world.    

Videos recounting public officers’ efforts since the start of the pandemic, as well as how the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated work, workforce and workplace transformation were also unveiled.   

&emsp; ii. &emsp; <u>Public Sector Transformation (PST) Awards Celebration, 21 October</u>

The PST Awards is a Whole-of-Government pinnacle platform to recognise and reward public agencies and officers for excellence in their work and organisational practices. This year, there are 80 PST Award winners across 12 categories.

A video message from Guest-of-Honour, Minister Chan Chun Sing, will also be played. Family members would be able to join in the Celebration as award recipients and officers stream the event ‘live’ from home. 

&emsp; iii. &emsp; <u> Learning Festival, 12 – 30 October</u>

In partnership with the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE), PSD is co-organising a Learning Festival. Held virtually for the first time, the festival comprises a line-up of more than 100 virtual learning sessions hosted by public agencies and training partners for officers to level up their skills and capabilities. The sessions are open to all public officers.
